# m2: later work

## Goal

Later work: deferred features, design studies, and experiments.

## Plan

Nothing here blocks a release. Promote a quest into
[m1](/quest/m1/README.md) when it joins the next wave, including planning
work whose decisions are worth settling now; deferral does not abandon a
feature. A study may end with a measured no-go. Work gated on hardware, a
partner, a consumer, a provider, or an upstream release, or with no named
consumer yet, waits in [m3](/quest/m3/README.md).

## Required

- [RTSP import](/quest/m2/rtsp-import.md) - `moq import rtsp` publishes an IP camera from its own network, through a `moq-rtsp` crate whose one-session ingest a caller can supervise itself
- [One port](/quest/m2/one-port/README.md) - one UDP port carries QUIC, SRT, and WebRTC media through an embedder hook, and one TCP port carries HTTP, RTMP, and RTMPS
- [Bitrate claim](/quest/m2/rate-claim.md) - tokens and auth grants cap a session's upload and download bitrate, refused where unenforced and always on HTTP
- [QUIC caps](/quest/m2/rate-quic.md) - paced MAX_DATA credit in and a capped pacer out hold a QUIC session to its token's bitrate
- [WebSocket caps](/quest/m2/rate-websocket.md) - paced reads and writes over bounded socket buffers hold WebSocket to the same caps
- [Publishers learn their cap](/quest/m2/rate-grant.md) - the AUTH grant carries the caps and publishers clamp their encoder to them
- [One port on the io_uring workers](/quest/m2/uring-demux.md) - `moq-uring`'s workers host the UDP demux, so a ring relay keeps WebRTC media and SRT on its QUIC port
- [Synced data playback](/quest/m2/watch-data-sync.md) - js/watch releases JSON and binary payloads on the media playhead, and a slow data track holds media back
- [Watch decode gate](/quest/m2/watch-decode-gate.md) - video lookahead stays encoded until it is near presentation, like audio
- [Hitless TS legs](/quest/m2/ts-hitless.md) - two `--sync` export legs emit packet-identical TS for ST 2022-7
- [DVB E-AC-3](/quest/m2/ts-eac3.md) - E-AC-3 private data is split per access unit (independent frame plus its dependent substreams) and buffer-modelled in TS export
- [T-STD controls](/quest/m2/tstd-controls.md) - the harness gains an MB-overflow control and an AAC broadcast reference
- [MP4 export](/quest/m2/mp4-export.md) - `moq export mp4 --output` records crash-safe fragments, then finishes a regular MP4 with moov at the end
- [fMP4 edit lists](/quest/m2/fmp4-edit-lists.md) - the fMP4 importer applies edit lists to frame timestamps
- [Shared timebase in the bindings](/quest/m2/ffi-timebase.md) - binding apps publish several containers from one source on one shared offset
- [Linux decoded frames](/quest/m2/obs-decode-linux.md) - present supported native decoded surfaces with visible CPU fallback
- [Windows decoded frames](/quest/m2/obs-decode-windows.md) - present decoded D3D11 surfaces in OBS without CPU readback
- [macOS GPU input](/quest/m2/obs-macos.md) - feed the encoder from the OBS compositor without CPU readback
- [Windows GPU input](/quest/m2/obs-windows.md) - import or blit OBS D3D11 textures with explicit synchronization
- [Sans-IO IETF session](/quest/m2/rs2ts-sans-io-ietf.md) - the moq-transport session is driven by bytes and tick(now), so it can translate
- [IETF parameters](/quest/m2/rs2ts-ietf-params.md) - the IETF codec drops its `Param` trait on primitives, so it translates like lite
- [Generated IETF](/quest/m2/rs2ts-ietf.md) - @moq/net's moq-transport session is generated too
- [Per-stream deadlines](/quest/m2/quic-deadline.md) - hopeless retransmits
  become resets, and a tail loss probe fires early while there is still time
- [qmux on the QUIC stream state machine](/quest/m2/quic-qmux.md) - qmux is a
  first-class crate in the fork over the shared stream state machine
- [Align BBR loss handling with draft-06](/quest/m2/quic-bbr-loss-parity.md) - losses use their own sample and the draft-05 links go, keeping the spurious-loss undo that already re-enters ProbeUp through Refill
- [Measure ECN on the backbone](/quest/m2/quic-ecn-measure.md) - a written
  verdict on marking versus dropping, and whether Linode and OVH keep marks
- [Per-stream ACK progress](/quest/m2/quic-ack-progress.md) - `moq-quic` reports
  how far a send stream has been acknowledged and when
- [poll_acked on moq-net's send stream](/quest/m2/quic-ack-hook.md) - the
  backend-neutral hook on moq-net's own transport trait that awaits an
  acknowledged stream offset, implemented by the moq-tokio and moq-uring adapters
- [Starvation at frame granularity](/quest/m2/starvation-frames.md) - the
  acknowledged frontier moves at every frame boundary through `poll_acked`,
  with a delivery-delay histogram for jitter
- [#3199](/quest/m2/3199-moq-uring-remove-sq-indirection-and-per-enter-ring-fd.md) - moq-uring: remove SQ indirection and per-enter ring fd lookup, if a profile shows the win

- [Send depth](/quest/m2/send-depth.md) - moq-net futures prove Send at the default recursion limit, so downstream crates see no nightly lint
- [Refusal reasons](/quest/m2/refusal-reasons.md) - refused-session metrics tell an expired token from an invalid one, and count gateway admissions
- [Bench coverage](/quest/m2/bench-coverage.md) - Criterion targets for moq-pattern matching first, then moq-mux containers

- [mTLS on tls://](/quest/m2/tls-listener-mtls.md) - a `tls://` listener can identify a cluster peer by its client certificate
- [Link quality](/quest/m2/link-quality.md) - a radio link's cost follows its measured quality without flapping routes
- [One transport adapter](/quest/m2/transport-adapter-dedup.md) - the poll transport adapter exists once, and the 64 KiB cap in moq-net's default `poll_read_buf` (not in the adapter) has a test
- [Archive S3 wire proof](/quest/m2/archive-s3.md) - the archive proof also runs through the S3 client against an in-process S3-compatible server
- [Archive recovery listing](/quest/m2/archive-recovery-listing.md) - a resumed DVR lists what changed since its checkpoint, not every stored group
- [Range-addressed HLS playlists](/quest/m2/hls-ranges.md) - `moq-hls` lists a start-to-end range of a recording as its own playlist, for moq.pro's managed HLS
- [DASH rendition URLs](/quest/m2/dash-rendition-uri.md) - DASH init and segment URLs percent-encode the rendition name, so a name with a slash resolves to its own rendition
- [IETF on the ring](/quest/m2/uring-ietf.md) - the io_uring workers serve moq-transport sessions too, so a uring relay drops no client protocol

- [Keep-alive from the idle timeout](/quest/m2/quic-keep-alive.md) - the keep-alive interval defaults to a fraction of the negotiated idle timeout; an explicit `quic.keep_alive` overrides
- [Socket close](/quest/m2/noq-socket-close.md) - moq-tokio's QUIC endpoint releases its socket on close, so it drops its wrapper
