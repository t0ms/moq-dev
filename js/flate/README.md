# @moq/flate

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@moq/flate)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moq/flate)
[![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-ready-blue.svg)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Opaque byte tracks over MoQ, optionally compressed with group-scoped DEFLATE, in two modes:

- `Snapshot`: **lossy**. One value updated over time; a consumer reads every value it receives (`next()`) or skips to the most recent (`latest()`).
- `Stream`: **lossless**. An ordered append-log of self-contained payloads, nothing superseded.

The bytes are opaque: the tracks frame them onto a [`@moq/net`](../net) track and optionally compress them, and never look inside. For JSON documents reach for [`@moq/json`](../json) instead, which adds RFC 7396 merge-patch deltas on top of the same two modes and codec. Interoperable with the Rust [`moq-flate`](https://crates.io/crates/moq-flate) crate.

```ts
import { Snapshot, Stream } from "@moq/flate";
import { Time } from "@moq/net";

const thumbnail = new Snapshot.Producer({ track, compression: "deflate" });
thumbnail.update({ value: jpeg, at: Time.Timestamp.now() });

const log = new Stream.Consumer({ track: subscriber, compression: "deflate" });
for await (const { value, at } of log) {
	console.log(value.byteLength, at);
}
```

Compression is opt-in per track (`compression: "none" | "deflate"`, default `"none"`); a consumer must set the same value as the producer.

Producers take `{ value, at }`, where `at` is the capture time written as the frame timestamp, and consumers return the same shape. Nothing fills in now: a timed track needs `at` on every write, and an untimed track takes none and reads back without one.

## Codec

A sequence of frame payloads is compressed into a single raw DEFLATE ([RFC 1951](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951.html)) stream, sync-flushed at each frame boundary. Every frame is self-delimited (byte-aligned, the window retained) while later frames reuse the earlier ones as context, so a stream of similar payloads (a snapshot followed by deltas, repeated records, log lines) compresses far better than each payload alone.

This is plain raw DEFLATE with a `Z_SYNC_FLUSH` after each frame, so it interoperates on the wire with any peer using the same primitive, including the Rust [`moq-flate`](https://crates.io/crates/moq-flate) crate. The fixed 4-byte sync-flush marker is stripped per frame ([RFC 7692](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7692.html#section-7.2.1)'s permessage-deflate trick). There is no length prefix: the caller frames each slice ([`@moq/net`](../net) already does).

```ts
import { Encoder, Decoder } from "@moq/flate";

const encoder = new Encoder();
const a = encoder.frame(new TextEncoder().encode("the quick brown fox"));
const b = encoder.frame(new TextEncoder().encode("the quick brown dog")); // smaller: reuses the window

// Feed slices to the decoder in the same order they were produced.
const decoder = new Decoder();
new TextDecoder().decode(decoder.frame(a)); // "the quick brown fox"
new TextDecoder().decode(decoder.frame(b)); // "the quick brown dog"
```

Create a fresh `Encoder`/`Decoder` pair per independent stream (in moq-net terms, per group). `new Encoder({ level })` sets the DEFLATE level (`0..=9`, default `6`); `new Decoder({ maxFrameSize })` caps how far a single frame may inflate (default 64 MiB), rejecting zip bombs.
