 * sides negotiate MoQ Auth, presents the credential its connection already carried (the
 * URL, or nothing) right after setup, and learns the {@link Grant} it earned. Older
 * versions, and peers that do not negotiate it, carry no AUTH exchange: the grant stays
 * undefined and {@link Auth.add} rejects with {@link Unsupported}. {@link Auth.grant} is
 * the union of every token this side presented, and {@link Auth.add} presents another
 * without reconnecting. Mirrors the Rust `moq_net::auth`.
