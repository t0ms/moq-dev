# [S] moq-uring tests pass under parallel load

## Goal

`just check` passes while several checks run on one machine. During the
2026-10-06 parallel quest run, moq-uring tests failed while concurrent runs
shared an 8 MiB `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`. It recurred on 2026-10-08: four
`moq-uring` worker tests failed on ENOMEM during a 19-agent quest run, in a PR
that never touched the crate.

## Plan

Fix at the cause, never with a retry or longer timeout:

- Locked memory: start from the nextest `io-uring` test group
  (`.config/nextest.toml`), which already holds one run to four ring tests at
  a time; the failures came from several runs sharing one user's budget.
  Measure what each test ring locks and whether tests can share
  or shrink rings. If configuration must change, make the supported dev-shell
  and CI setup actually allow the tests to pass under parallel load.
  `Error::ring` already reports `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` on ENOMEM; check that this
  reaches the failing tests. A clearer failure alone does not meet the goal.
- Decided 2026-10-10: `deadline_fires_at_park` and
  `dropped_worker_rejects_operations`, which failed under heavy load and
  passed alone, moved to [moq-uring on moq-time](/quest/m1/time/uring.md),
  which puts the worker on a controlled clock. Leave `remote_wake_unparks`
  alone; it is not this quest.
- Keep this resource-sharing follow-up standalone: it has no shared fixture
  with the current children of the load-flake questline. Run the affected
  tests during parallel checks and wire any new coverage into CI.
