# In-tree interop test

Cross-language interop test that builds every client from **this checkout**
and runs them against each other.

This is the in-tree companion to [moq-dev/smoke](https://github.com/moq-dev/smoke).
That repo installs each client from its public package registry (crates.io, PyPI,
npm, ...) to catch *packaging* breakage in a release. This one builds each client
from the workspace source (`cargo`, `bun`, `uv`, `cc`) to catch *interop*
regressions before anything is published. No apt/brew/npm/PyPI, and no
distribution-mechanism matrix.

It stands up a `moq-relay`, then for each publisher language publishes an H.264
broadcast and confirms every subscriber sees data flowing before the timeout.
Most subscribers check for a non-empty frame. The browser additionally verifies
WebCodecs output painted to a canvas and drives the player's pause/resume controls.
Every publisher but the Rust CLI also carries an Opus track, which the browser
subscriber checks end-to-end: the browser encodes fake microphone audio, and the
Python, Go, and C++ clients encode a synthetic tone through `moq-ffi` at a 2.5 ms frame
duration, so the matrix covers the FFI audio path with a non-default codec config.

The normal run also checks a finite raw track through the relay. Its publisher
announces end 4 before writing four 256 KiB groups; the reader verifies every byte,
exactly groups 0 through 3, and a clean end at 4. Rust-to-Rust always runs. Selecting
native JS adds both Rust-to-JS and JS-to-Rust under that runtime, so `--all` covers
Node and Bun. `--tail` runs just these five lanes. The wire-compat lanes, which swap in released relays and clients, skip them.

The finite clients keep their session alive until the harness acknowledges the
reader's complete clean end over stdin, so a lane tests delivery rather than
shutdown. No sleep stands in for drain completion. A missing group, error, or
stall fails the lane; the timeout only bounds failure. QUIC on localhost rarely
reorders, so the ordering race remains covered by transport unit tests.

Every client closes its session on the way out: publishers stop when their input
ends (the browser on SIGTERM), and subscribers close once they have their frame.
After each publisher's round, the harness waits for the relay to log the close of
every connection the round opened, and fails the round for any connection the relay
timed out instead. A client that stalls and reconnects therefore fails, rather than
passing as a slow cell, even when the idle-out lands after its cell finished. The
check covers runs built from this checkout; the wire-compat lanes, which swap in
released relays and clients, skip it.

Whenever the browser subscriber is in the run, the matrix ends with a close-code
case: Chromium dials the relay with a token its public rules refuse, and
`WebTransport.closed` must carry the relay's code and reason. Chromium treats a
server's HTTP/3 control stream ending as fatal, so a server that ends it under
the close capsule loses both; no Rust peer is that strict.

`just test media` is a separate, browser-only run that asks a harder
question: is the media a viewer gets actually advancing and in sync, and does the
player survive the publication lifecycle. See [Media QA](#media-qa).

## Clients

| Client | Source under test | Built with | Roles |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rust | `rs/moq-relay` + `rs/moq-cli` | `cargo build` | publish (video) + subscribe |
| Python | `py/moq-rs` (+ `rs/moq-ffi`, import `moq`) | `uv build` wheels (maturin + hatchling), installed into a venv in the run directory | publish (video + audio) + subscribe |
| Go | `go/wrapper` (+ `rs/moq-ffi`, import `moq-go/moq`) | `sh/go/stage.sh` (uniffi-bindgen-go) + `go build` | publish (video + audio) + subscribe |
| C++ | `cpp/moq` (+ `rs/moq-ffi`, `find_package(moq-cpp)`) | `cmake` build + install of `cpp/moq` (uniffi-bindgen-cpp), then `cmake` for the client | publish (video + audio) + subscribe |
| Browser | `js/watch` + `js/publish` | `vite build` + headless Chromium (Playwright) | publish (video + audio) + rendered playback |
| Native JS | `js/net` + `js/hang` + the npm `@moq/web-transport` polyfill | `node` (tsx) and `bun` | subscribe |
| C | `rs/moq-c` | `cargo build -p moq-c` + `cc` | subscribe |
| GStreamer | `rs/moq-gst` (`moqsrc`) | `cargo build -p moq-gst` + `gst-launch-1.0` | subscribe |

The browser, native JS, C, and GStreamer clients subscribe only by choice
(publishing media needs an encoder the native JS runtimes lack, the C client is
intentionally minimal, and `moqsink` publishing needs request-pad muxing this
client doesn't drive). Rust, Python, Go, C++, and the browser publish.

The Go client builds against the modules `sh/go/stage.sh` assembles from
this checkout: `moq-ffi` compiled for the host, bindings regenerated with
`uniffi-bindgen-go`, and the `go/wrapper` module wired to them by a `replace`.
That is the same staging `just go check` uses, so this cell covers the Go
wrapper end to end rather than only compiling it. A shell without
`uniffi-bindgen-go` (the nix devShell ships it) marks the cell unavailable.

The C++ client builds against the package the way an external project would:
`interop.sh` configures, builds, and installs `cpp/moq` into the run directory,
then builds `clients/cpp` with `find_package(moq-cpp)` pointed at that prefix. A
shell without `cmake` or `uniffi-bindgen-cpp` (the nix devShell ships both)
marks the cell unavailable.

The GStreamer client builds the `moqsrc` plugin from `rs/moq-gst` and points
`GST_PLUGIN_PATH` at it, then reads a broadcast with
`gst-launch-1.0 moqsrc ... ! filesink`. The plugin dynamic-links the host's
GStreamer, so this cell needs `gst-launch-1.0` + the core plugins on the system.
The `nix develop` shell ships them; a bare shell without GStreamer marks the cell
unavailable rather than failing it.

The `@moq/web-transport` polyfill is the one dependency that comes from npm rather
than this checkout: it's a prebuilt NAPI QUIC/HTTP3 addon, not part of the moq
source tree. Everything else (`@moq/net`, `@moq/hang`, ...) resolves to the
workspace packages, because the JS clients here are bun workspace members.

## Auth

The relay verifies tokens through `moq auth serve` with a key generated for the
run; nothing is anonymous. Each publisher dials with a token for its broadcast's
subtree and each subscriber with one to read it, so every cell also covers the
`?jwt=` URL path in every client.

Clients that print the grant the relay sent back over AUTH, as an
`auth granted publish=[...] subscribe=[...]` line, must report exactly what
their token implies: the Rust CLI (a `moq_net::auth` debug log) and the native
JS subscribers. A cell whose grant is missing or wrong fails even when media
flowed. The binding clients (Python, Go, C, GStreamer) have no grant to print
until moq-ffi exposes one, and the browser's shared connection keeps its session
private, so their cells check media alone. AUTH is only on the work-in-progress
moq-lite-07, so the printing clients dial `moq-lite-07-wip` alone and a printing
client that reports nothing never got its grant. The native JS subscribers dial
WebTransport alone, since the WebSocket fallback cannot offer it. The rest keep
their defaults, so the matrix also crosses versions through the relay, which
accepts both.

After the matrix, each publisher whose refusal the harness can read (Rust) runs
once more with a token that excludes its broadcast. It must fail loud, logging
Unauthorized and naming the path, and every subscriber must time out. The
browser publisher enforces its grant too, but its elements cannot offer
`moq-lite-07-wip` yet.

Tokens use patterns no prefix could carry, so every cell checks that AUTH\_OK
delivers them as minted: a publisher is granted its exact broadcast, a subscriber
`**/name` (a leading `**` matching zero segments), and the refused publisher
`interop-allowed-*.hang`.

## Running locally

You need the workspace toolchain on `PATH` (cargo, ffmpeg, bun, uv, go,
uniffi-bindgen-go, cmake, uniffi-bindgen-cpp, a C/C++ compiler). `nix develop` provides all of it except
Playwright's Chromium, which
`interop.sh` fetches on first run (`bunx playwright install chromium`).

```bash
# Default: rust publishes, rust subscribes (a fast sanity check).
just test interop

# Full matrix: rust/python/go/cpp/browser publish; everyone subscribes.
just test interop --all

# Pick your own axes:
just test interop --publishers rust,python --subscribers rust,c,js-native-bun

# Finite track tails only: Rust-to-Rust and Rust/Node/Bun in both directions.
just test interop --tail

# Subscription termination: Rust/JS response bytes over in-memory transports.
just test bare-fin

# Negative control: no publisher, every subscriber must time out.
just test interop-negative

# Browser-to-browser media output and lifecycle, plus its own negative controls.
just test media
```

Subscriber names: `rust`, `python`, `go`, `cpp`, `js` (browser), `js-native-node`,
`js-native-bun`, `c`, `gst`. Publisher names: `rust`, `python`, `go`, `cpp`, `js`.

A client whose source build fails fails only its own matrix cells (see
`mark_broken` in `interop.sh`); it never aborts the rest of the run.

## Released wire compatibility

`just test wire-compat` compares this checkout with the newest stable,
non-yanked crates.io and npm releases. The existing Interop workflow runs it
nightly and on demand on `main`. Registry installation is omitted from PR runs;
resolver and removed-version regressions run through `just test harness`.

The run records exact releases, npm's resolved lockfile, both CLI help outputs,
and each matrix cell in the harness artifacts. It uses checksummed GitHub
binaries when available on Linux x86\_64, with an exact-version `cargo install`
fallback. Run inside `nix develop` with GitHub CLI registry access.

Four sources sign JWTs: current and published Rust CLI, and current and
published `@moq/auth`. Both Rust CLIs and both JavaScript packages verify every
token and assert its normalized root and permission scope. Current and released
`hang` and `@moq/hang` encode and decode one another's catalogs and legacy frame
headers, checking the exact timestamp and payload. These are format checks,
independent of a media decoder.

The session lanes take the moq-lite drafts from each CLI's `--connect-version`
choices. IETF drafts are left out on purpose: our clients and relays always
prefer moq-lite with each other, and `just test interop` covers IETF. The relay
offers only the cell's version, and JavaScript checks the negotiated version.
The relay is anonymous here, since released binaries may predate AUTH; the
default matrix covers tokens and grants.
Current Rust media publishers feed released Rust and JS readers, then released
publishers feed current readers, through both relay sources. Rust exports must
decode to a video frame through ffmpeg. The existing JS subscriber
reconstructs the catalog and decodes the container.

Each `moq-net` library states whether a draft has FETCH (lite-05 onward
today). A draft without it in both is logged and its FETCH lanes skipped; one
the release supports and the checkout dropped fails. Both Rust versions FETCH the group the
publisher's own JS subscriber observed and compare every frame's exact
payload. JS publishers write one group after that subscriber's demand, and the
opposite-source Rust CLI FETCHes it by the same observed ID.

Every session cell runs, and the run counts the cells that ran and were
skipped, then lists each failing cell before it fails.
Checkout-only versions are logged and omitted. Removing a released version
fails before sessions start. A maintainer-approved break belongs in
`compat/planned-breaks.json` with its reason and the exact affected release
versions. Keyed by a protocol name it drops that version; with `cells` it
skips only the named lanes, optionally narrowed to versions, a relay source,
or a publisher source. Every skipped cell is logged with the break's name.
Entries become errors once an affected release changes or no longer offers a
listed version, forcing removal or a fresh review. Future WIP drafts receive
no automatic exception.

## Media QA

The matrix asks "did bytes arrive and did a pixel light up". That passes on a
frozen picture, on silence, and on audio a second out of step, so
`just test media` measures the media itself, browser to browser.

The publisher is a fixture, not a fake camera: a canvas painting a frame counter
as black/white blocks, and a tone stepping through a fixed frequency table. Both
are indexed off one `AudioContext` clock, so the subscriber can read the frame it
is presenting off the canvas, read the tone step off the player's own audio
graph, and compare them. **Everything measured is browser output.** Nothing here
observes a physical speaker or display; a run says the player emitted the right
samples, not that a machine played them.

Each run covers, against a real local relay:

- **capabilities** - probes every platform API the player needs, and fails
  naming what is missing rather than skipping a case.
- **cold start** - the publisher reports when it is announced and encoding, then
  a fresh page joins. No reload, unlike the matrix driver: a subscriber that
  needs a second page load is an initialization bug, not a race.
- **user gesture** - Chromium is launched with
  `--autoplay-policy=document-user-activation-required`, which applies to
  top-level Web Audio contexts. The fixture and player graphs must be suspended
  before either page is clicked, then both must carry audio afterwards. Harness
  state probes use CDP with `userGesture: false`: Playwright's usual page reads
  themselves grant activation and would invalidate this assertion.
- **capture permission** - the camera case uses a fake device for deterministic
  input, while Playwright denies and then grants permissions. Both source errors
  must be visible; neither a full nor a microphone-only denial may announce a
  broadcast. Granting both permissions must recover and encode without reload.
  The fake device is not physical hardware, and the headless permission decision
  is not a person clicking a browser prompt.
- **pause and resume**, **unsubscribe and rejoin**, **detach and reattach**,
  **publisher stop and same-path republish**, and **late join**. The late
  joiner may first show the GOP from before the demand gap, but it must present
  a frame within 5s of loading and then play, with the presented frame moving,
  within 1.5s of the fixture's painted frame within 2s, both bounds about twice
  the worst seen in looped runs under CPU load. A rejoin and a reattach cross
  the same demand gap, so they must reach live the same way.
- **resources return to baseline** - the page wraps `WebTransport`, `WebSocket`,
  `AudioContext`, and `Worker` to count live instances, so a detach that leaks a
  session is visible rather than merely invisible.

Tolerances come from the fixture: video must present at half the fixture's 30fps
or better and never go backwards, the tone must stand 15dB above the spectrum's
median, and audio/video skew must stay within one 200ms tone step for 90% of
samples. One step is the floor set by the analyser window straddling a step
boundary and the canvas holding a frame up to one frame old.

Each window opens once the player's audio buffer has filled and plays. Until
then the player holds its first decoded frame, silent, for its sync delay, which
rises past 400ms under load; that is startup, not a gap in playback.

The run ends with negative controls. Each injects a defect and names the
assertion that has to catch it, and passes only by failing there:

| Control | Must fail |
|---|---|
| tone muted at the source | `audio tone` |
| picture frozen after the first frame | `video progress` |
| tone table shifted 800ms ahead of the picture | `audio/video sync` |
| the detached player's session never torn down | `resource baseline` |
| the latecomer's player delayed 3s behind live | `late join reaches live` |

The leaked-session control waits for an extra `AudioContext` rather than an extra
session: every player on one relay URL shares a transport, so a session count
cannot move.

Not covered yet: other browser engines (the capability probe is the groundwork)
and any claim about physical playback.

The relay's port is reserved for the run rather than fixed, so two checkouts can
run the interop test at once; `INTEROP_PORT` pins one instead. A failing run keeps its
directory, including a Playwright trace of the failing page, and CI uploads it;
`MOQ_TEST_KEEP=1` keeps a passing run's too. See [the harness
contract](../README.md).

```

## CI

`.github/workflows/interop.yml` runs the full matrix nightly (and on demand, and on
PRs that touch `test/interop/`). A red cell means a real interop break in the
current tree.

## Subscription termination

`just test bare-fin` exchanges encoded subscription responses between Rust and
JS, then feeds them into each implementation's subscriber over an in-memory
transport. It checks bare FIN before and after SUBSCRIBE\_START on lite-05/06/07,
and FIN without PUBLISH\_DONE on IETF draft-19. Clean-end controls use the same
path. This tests response interoperability, not network delivery or relay behavior.
The interop workflow runs it alongside the real-transport matrix.

## Varints

Every `just test interop` run starts with `varint_interop` in moq-net, which
hands moq-net's QUIC and leading-ones encodings of each varint size boundary
(plus 2^53, where a JS `number` stops being exact, and 2^62 - 1) to
`varint.ts`. That script decodes them into js/net's `U64`, checks its
`number` conversion, and returns js/net's own encodings, which Rust requires to
match byte for byte and decode back to the same value.

`lite_varint_interop` runs next to it and does the same through moq-lite's
version dispatch: `lite-varint.ts` decodes Rust's lite-06 (QUIC) and lite-07
(leading-ones) varints, a SETUP carrying a 62-bit Hop ID, a datagram, and a
GROUP stream with frames, and re-encodes them byte for byte. Past 2^62-1 the
range is per version: JS writes lite-07's 64-bit values, which Rust reads back,
and JS refuses them on lite-06.

`ietf_datagram_interop` does the same for moq-transport's `OBJECT_DATAGRAM` on
drafts 14 through 22: `ietf-datagram.ts` decodes Rust's datagrams and their
Timestamps and re-encodes them byte for byte, and Rust decodes the datagram the
JS publisher sends.
