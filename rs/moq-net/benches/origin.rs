//! Fan-out benchmarks for the origin: its route table, the announce cursors
//! watching it, request resolution, the handoff between local sources, and the
//! delivery through a front.
//!
//! Every shape is swept over both axes, publishers (routes) and subscribers
//! (cursors), so a cost that grows with the size of the table rather than with
//! the tree around the touched path shows up as a slope. The table is a trie
//! keyed by path segment: an announcement visits only the cursors on the walk
//! down to its prefix and beneath it. Competing routes at that prefix are
//! ranked once per change, then each cursor selects its first visible entry.
//!
//! `origin/narrow*` put a session in front of the origin, since a narrowing is
//! enforced by the session serving it: every subscription holds a gate on the
//! session's grant, and a narrowing wakes each one. The baseline is a session
//! that never narrows.
//!
//! An equal-cost pool is swept the same way, over its members and the paths it
//! already serves, and over those paths and the cursors watching the pool.
//!
//! A route swap on one front is swept over its tracks and the copies each track
//! still holds from earlier routes, and a front retiring over the fronts around it.
//!
//! Run with `cargo bench -p moq-net --bench origin`.
