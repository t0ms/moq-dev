//! MPEG-TS muxer.
//!
//! [`Export`] subscribes to a MoQ broadcast and produces MPEG-TS: PAT/PMT program
//! tables and PES packets, packetized into 188-byte TS packets, with the PCR
//! riding its own adaptation-field-only packets on a fixed media-time grid.
//! Output is sliced on that grid rather than per media frame (the schedule):
//! each [`Frame`] is one slot's clock packet plus the bytes belonging to it,
//! stamped at the slot boundary, so the clock a receiver recovers from byte
//! position agrees with the values, and a pacing caller releases each slot at
//! the instant it asserts. Video is carried as Annex-B, audio as ADTS AAC.
//!
//! Every frame is muxed a fixed delay after its decode time ([`Export::with_delay`]),
//! so tracks interleave in `(DTS, PID)` order whatever the arrival skew between them,
//! and the output keeps the source's pace.
//!
//! Video flows through `ExportSource`, which normalizes every H.264/H.265
//! source to length-prefixed NALU plus a resolved avcC/hvcC (parsing in-band
//! avc3/hev1 parameter sets out of the bitstream, or taking the catalog
//! `description` for out-of-band avc1/hvc1). The muxer then does one
//! length-prefixed -> Annex-B conversion, re-injecting the parameter sets as
//! inline NALs on every keyframe. CMAF tracks are rejected with a clear error.
