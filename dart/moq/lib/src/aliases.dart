import 'package:moq_ffi/moq_ffi.dart';

// Re-export the UniFFI types without their `Moq` prefix, so consumers spell
// them the way the Rust API does. These are type aliases, not wrappers: the
// values are the exact same objects, so every generated method applies
// unchanged and the prefixed names stay valid.
//
// Four types are deliberately not aliased, because the unprefixed name is
// already taken where this package is used:
//
//   * `MoqServer` - `Server` is the listen facade in server.dart.
//   * `MoqContainer` / `MoqRoute` - `Container` and `Route` are Flutter's, and
//     an ambiguous import would break every Flutter app that uses them.
//   * `MoqException` - `Exception` is in `dart:core`.
