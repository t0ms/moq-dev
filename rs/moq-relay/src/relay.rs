//! The assembled relay: every startup step, in one place, in the right order.
//!
//! [`Relay::load`] turns a [`Config`] into the running pieces (server, client,
//! auth, cluster, stats, internal + web listeners), and [`Relay::run`] drives
//! them. `main.rs` is a thin wrapper over the two.
//!
//! # Why this is a type and not just `main`
//!
//! An embedder wanting the relay PLUS its own workers - extra routes on the web
//! server, an in-process recorder against [`cluster::Cluster::origin`], another listener
//! in its own `select!` - loads a [`Relay`], clones the handles it needs, mounts
//! routes, and calls [`Relay::run`]. The owner keeps the listeners, worker
//! threads, error propagation, and shutdown joins, so a new socket added here
//! cannot be dropped by a `..` pattern that still compiles.
//!
//! That distinction matters because this crate is consumed as a git dependency.
//! A caller who copies the sequence gets a step added here as a library update
//! with no call site on their end, and nothing says so: the config still parses,
//! nothing errors, and the feature reports as configured while doing nothing.
//! Calling `load` means a new step arrives with the update, and a reshaped API
//! is a compile error.
