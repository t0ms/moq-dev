# Commits

PRs into `main` are squash-merged through the merge queue, so the PR title becomes the commit subject and the PR description becomes the body in `git log`.
The one exception is the maintainer's pre-release merge of `release` into `main`, which lands as a merge commit (see [Releases](#releases)).
PRs into `release` use a merge commit, so their history survives until they land.

- Use conventional-commit subjects (`feat(watch): ...`, `fix: ...`, `chore: ...`, `docs: ...`)
- AI commit attribution goes in a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer, not the commit body.
- Never commit binaries or build artifacts (`.a`, `.so`, `.dylib`, `.dll`, wheels).

# PRs

Keep the body short and structured, not narrated.
Have at least these sections:

- **Problem**: a summary of the problem and why this PR is needed.
- **Approach**: a summary of the approach taken to solve the problem.
- **Impact**: a bullet point for every public API/wire change made.
- **Alternatives**: any alternative approaches considered.
- **Follow-ups**: any issues encountered or quests created.

When pushing additional commits to an existing PR, update the title and description if needed.
When taking over someone else's PR, push commits on top of theirs so they keep credit.

Create a draft PR.
Switch it to "Ready for review" when you're finished and local `just check` passes.
Fix any merge conflicts and failing CI checks.

# Merge queue

PRs into `main` land through a merge queue, which re-runs **Check** and **Test** on the PR combined with the latest `main` and the PRs queued ahead of it.
Enqueue a reviewed PR with `gh pr merge <number>`.

A dequeued PR means the combination failed checks, timed out, or no longer meets the ruleset.
Read the removal reason in the PR timeline and the merge group run, fix the cause, and enqueue again.

Never bypass the queue with `--admin`, with one exception: the maintainer's pre-release merge of `release` into `main`, since the queue would squash it.

# AI

AI-assisted issues, pull requests, reviews, and comments are welcome.
Especially bug reports; dive deep into the root issue before proposing a solution.

GitHub issues are the public front door for brainstorming.
Prefer a quest for work needing durable scope or coordination.

# Reviews

AI agents review pushes on their own, skipping ones they judge trivial.
Never explicitly request a review.

For each finding:

- If you don't agree with it, reply to the finding and move on.
- If it's a relatively easy improvement, fix it and push. Update the summary if needed.

Wait for a review from any reviewer other than Grok.
Codex (OpenAI) reacts with a thumbs up when it has no findings; that counts as a review.
A push that gets no new review once CI finishes was judged trivial, so the earlier review still covers it.
Skipped or rate-limited reviews do not count.
For a fork with no automatic non-Grok review, ask the maintainer to arrange one.
Merge only when that review has no findings, or every finding is fixed or replied to.

# CI

Workflow steps run `just` recipes, never a script path; `just gh check` enforces it.

# Follow-ups

If you encounter issues, or findings that are out of scope, create follow-up quests.
Focus on the core problem, offering a potential solution only if its obvious.
For non-trivial tasks, file an issue or offer to run `/quest-plan`.

# Forks

[moq-dev/noq](https://github.com/moq-dev/noq) publishes `moq-noq*`, the QUIC stack every published MoQ crate builds on; iroh keeps upstream noq.
Its `moq-sync` workflow merges n0-computer/noq weekly as a PR; review it like any other, and `PARENT` names the upstream commit each release includes.
A carried change lists its upstream PR, or the reason it has none, in the fork PR.
For an advisory against noq or Quinn, compare the pinned release's `PARENT` with the fixing upstream commit, then sync, release the fork, and bump the pin here.

# Releases

`main` is the trunk; `release` is what ships, and release-plz and every branch-triggered publish run only there.

- A release is cut by hand: a PR merging `main` into `release`, with a merge commit.
- Consider a backport for any critical bug fix (crash, security, data loss, broken interop): land it on `main` first, then cherry-pick it onto `release` as a separate PR.
- Nothing merges `release` into `main` automatically. Before cutting a minor or breaking release, the maintainer merges `release` into `main` once, so trunk carries the published versions, CHANGELOGs, and any `release`-only commits. It lands as a merge commit with `--admin`, never squashed, so the cut starts from an advanced merge base.

# Versions

Releases are cut separately; bump only when asked. Each package's version lives in one place:

- **Rust**: release-plz owns crate versions and Rust dependency requirements.
- **JavaScript**: `js/*/package.json` packages with a `scripts.release` entry (skip private ones like `@moq/clock`, `@moq/wasm`), plus the matching workspace version in `bun.lock`.
- **Python**: `py/moq-rs/pyproject.toml`, plus the matching `moq-rs` entry in the root `uv.lock`; `py/moq-ffi` follows the `moq-ffi-v*` tag and Rust crate.
- **Swift**: `swift/VERSION`. **Kotlin**: `moq.version` in `kt/gradle.properties`. **Dart**: `version` in `dart/moq/pubspec.yaml`. Their FFI counterparts track the Rust crate.
- **Go**: `go/wrapper/VERSION` holds a human-owned `MAJOR.MINOR` line; CI derives the patch, so only edit it for a breaking API. Leave the placeholder FFI version in `go.mod` alone.
- **C++**: `cpp/moq/VERSION`, human-owned; a `cpp-v<version>` tag releases it.
- **OBS**: `cpp/obs/VERSION`, human-owned; each C++ release also cuts `obs-moq-v<version>`, and refuses one whose version already names an earlier release.
