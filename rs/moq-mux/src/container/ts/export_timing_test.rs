//! Timing of a delayed [`Export`] on a live clock: what a receiver renders when it joins a
//! broadcast already running, when one track loses frames, when the source's clock runs off the
//! receiver's, and when two receivers render one broadcast for a 1+1 (SMPTE ST 2022-7) pair.

//! Every case runs on the paused clock, with each frame written at the instant a live source
