//! In-band authorization: present tokens to the peer and learn what they grant.
//!
//! Each side of a session presents the credential its connection
//! already carried (the URL, a client certificate, or nothing) right after
//! setup, and learns the [`Grant`] it earned. [`Session::auth`](crate::Session::auth)
//! returns the [`Handle`]: [`grant`](Handle::grant) is the union of every token
//! this side presented, and [`add`](Handle::add) presents another without
//! reconnecting. Dropping the returned [`Token`] withdraws it.
//!
//! The other direction, answering the peer's tokens, is automatic: the session
//! grants what its own origin handles allow. An application that verifies tokens
//! itself takes [`requests`](Handle::requests) before running the session's
//! driver, and then answers every token the peer presents. Either way,
//! [`authorize`](Handle::authorize) re-authorizes the peer on a live session, narrower
//! or wider, on every version, whether or not it speaks AUTH.
//!
//! moq-transport draft-17+ carries the same exchange when both sides negotiate the
//! MoQ Auth extension. Older versions, and peers that do not negotiate it, carry no
//! AUTH exchange: there the grant stays `None` and [`add`](Handle::add) fails with
//! [`Error::Unsupported`]. moq-lite carries a grant's patterns as they are;
//! moq-transport carries namespace prefixes, so it refuses a grant that is not a
//! union of subtrees rather than widen it.
