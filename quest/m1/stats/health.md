# [M] Client health from stats and feedback

## Goal

One shared model turns a client's reports into a health sample and a verdict.
Given two snapshots of a publisher's `stats` track or a viewer's `.echo`
feedback, it yields rates and loss as deltas over a stated interval, and
classifies the connection and each rendition as unknown, healthy, degraded,
or unhealthy, naming the observer of every number (the publisher's
self-report, a viewer's report). Missing or stale reports are unknown, never
healthy. Rust and JS compute the same verdict from the same fixtures, so
[preflight](/quest/m1/stats/preflight.md) and downstream dashboards share it.
The demo dashboard and a `moq` CLI sink are possible consumers; wiring them
is follow-up work, not this quest.

Not here: per-project or per-connection inventories, dashboards, history, or
any relay-side session table. Downstream (moq.pro) keeps its project view.

## Plan

Decided 2026-10-05: the health sample and its classification are generic, so they move upstream
into this line; moq.pro keeps the per-project view and dashboard. Rejected:
deferring the model.

The model reads the shapes this line settled after
[#4510](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/4510): the publisher's `stats`
track named in the catalog, keyed by rendition ID, and viewers' `.echo`
broadcasts. Older downstream plans read client stats from a `.stats`
broadcast, which #4510 replaced with these tracks (the relay's own
`.stats/node/<node>` is unchanged); do not revive the client one.

Guidance, to be settled while building:

- Inputs are the snapshot types from [the schema](/quest/m1/stats/schema.md):
  `transport` (rtt, rate, cumulative bytes and packets lost, sample age) and
  the per-rendition counters. Decided in the 2026-10-10 audit: rendition
  rates and transport loss use deltas of cumulative counters over the two
  snapshots' interval. RTT and estimated rate remain gauges read as reported.
  A reset is detected by a counter decreasing or by the
  reporting broadcast's path or epoch changing
  ([Broadcast epochs](/quest/m0/broadcast-epoch/README.md)); the sample then
  starts over rather than going negative.
- Container sections such as `mpegts` are excluded from the verdict; their
  counters are read by their own consumers
  ([TS health counters](/quest/m2/ts-health-stats.md)).
- Thresholds are a documented default the caller can override, not policy
  baked into the types. Start from a few measured cases rather than guesses.
- A verdict carries its evidence: which inputs drove it and who observed them.
  A browser publisher with only PROBE rtt yields unknown for what it cannot
  see, never a guess.
- This quest classifies client reports only.
- Lives beside the snapshot types in `hang` and `@moq/hang` unless building
  it shows a better home.

A per-broadcast verdict combining client reports, the relay's starvation,
and publisher timeliness lives downstream, not here.

Prove a degrading publisher self-report, a degrading viewer report, a stale
report going unknown, and a counter reset by both a decrease and an epoch
change, from shared fixtures in both languages. Docs: the media section of `doc/concept/stats.md`.

Public API: new health types in `hang` and `@moq/hang`. Wire: none.

## Required

- [Schema](/quest/m1/stats/schema.md) - the snapshot types the model reads

## Related

- [QoS](/quest/m1/qos/README.md) - the relay's delivery counters, which a combined downstream verdict also reads
- [Broadcast epochs](/quest/m0/broadcast-epoch/README.md) - a new epoch is one way a counter reset shows
- [TS health counters](/quest/m2/ts-health-stats.md) - container counters kept out of the verdict
