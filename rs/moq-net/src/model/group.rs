//! A group is a stream of frames, split into a [Producer] and [Consumer] handle.
//!
//! A [Producer] writes an ordered stream of frames.
//! Frames can be written all at once ([Producer::write_frame]), or in chunks
//! ([Producer::create_frame]).
//!
//! A [Consumer] reads an ordered stream of frames.
//! The reader can be cloned, in which case each reader receives a copy of each frame. (fanout)
//!
//! Frames are numbered from 0 in write order. A group can be short at its front or its
//! back but never in the middle: [Producer::start_at] starts it later, so a handle can
//! carry the tail of a group whose leading frames came from somewhere else, and
//! [Producer::finish] ends it wherever writing stopped. [Consumer::set_frames] bounds a reader to a sub-range the same way [`track::Subscriber`]
//! bounds group sequences.
//!
//! The stream is closed with [Error] when all writers or readers are dropped.
