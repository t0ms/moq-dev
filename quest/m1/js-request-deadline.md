# [M] JS requests: one 10 s deadline from create to answer

## Goal

Every `@moq/net` request that waits for an answer runs under one fatal 10 s
timer, from creating its stream to the peer's first answer. That covers
subscribe, standalone track info, and fetch on lite and moq-transport, plus the
IETF publisher's PUBLISH_NAMESPACE. When it fires, the request fails, and any
stream it created is reset, including one that opens later. A create the
transport refuses, or one still pending when the timer fires, fails with a
local "no stream credit" error. A request the peer opened but never answered
fails with `ControlTimeout`. Announce interest and SubscribeNamespace bound
their create the same way but have no answer deadline, since they are
long-lived.

Nothing retries either failure. A request without credit is refused, which
sheds load instead of queueing work the caller can't see, and a timeout is
terminal.

## Plan

Decided 2026-10-07, re-planning the external
[#4999](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/4999) and
[#5001](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/5001):

- Fail fast without credit. Request opens pass `waitUntilAvailable: false`.
  Chrome already rejects an over-limit create at once with a `NetworkError`
  (crbug.com/487117768), and stays terminal. Firefox ignores the flag and
  queues, so the one timer bounds it; a stream that opens after that is reset.
  `@moq/qmux` gets the same fix upstream.
- One timer, not two. `OPEN_TIMEOUT_MS` (`openWithin` in
  `js/net/src/stream.ts`) stays the default for `Stream.open` and
  `Writer.open`, which SETUP, probe, and group streams inherit. Request sites
  opt out of it, and their setup timer (`SUBSCRIBE_SETUP_TIMEOUT_MS` in lite,
  `SUBSCRIBE_OK_TIMEOUT_MS` in IETF, and PUBLISH_NAMESPACE's
  `ADVERTISE_TIMEOUT_MS`, which moves from 5 s to the shared 10 s) covers the
  create as well as the answer.
- PUBLISH_NAMESPACE is in scope with no retry: both loops that advertise
  through `#advertise` (`runPublishNamespaces` and the draft-14/15 solicited
  `#runSubscribeNamespace`, `js/net/src/ietf/publisher.ts`) stop re-offering
  after either failure above. Both failures return `"dropped"` today, the
  answer that keeps the backoff running, so they need their own terminal
  answer. The namespace then stays unadvertised through that peer until it is
  republished or the session reconnects. Each loop still re-offers when the
  peer's REQUEST_ERROR names a retry interval, and keeps its backoff for a
  draft-14/15 refusal, which can't carry one (decided 2026-10-07 from review:
  the peer asked for those). Test both loops.
- The credit error is local, with no wire code. Propose its name in the PR;
  it is a new public `@moq/net` error.
- `@moq/watch` keeps ending a track on either failure. Rejected: #4999's
  resubscribe on a local timeout, since retrying adds a create per attempt and
  the timeout is meant to be fatal. Rejected: #5001's unbounded wait for a
  slot.
- Keep [#5002](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/5002)'s handling of a timer
  that fires mid-setup: the TRACK stream is reset, and a SUBSCRIBE stream that
  opens afterwards is reset with nothing written.
- Fix the stale text: "Chrome ~100" and "silently blocks" (IETF) or "the open
  blocks" (lite) in the subscribers' timeout comments (the cap is the peer's
  MAX_STREAMS; the Rust relay grants 10,000), `stream.ts`'s
  `QuotaExceededError` claim and its "matches the subscribe budget" note, and
  the "(browser stream limit reached?)" hint in the timeout messages.

Test with mocked time: a transport with a stream limit, covering an immediate
rejection, a queued create that times out with the credit error and is reset
when it opens, and an opened request with no answer that fails with
`ControlTimeout`. Cover lite and IETF draft 17.

Public API: one new error. Wire: none.
