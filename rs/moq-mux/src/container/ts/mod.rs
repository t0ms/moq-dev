//! MPEG-TS (transport stream).
//!
//! An interchange format only, not a wire format: [`Import`] demuxes a TS byte
//! stream into a broadcast and [`Export`] muxes a broadcast back into TS. The
//! codec layer (H.264/H.265/AAC, plus the legacy MP2/AC-3/E-AC-3 parsers) does
//! the elementary-stream parsing; this module only handles PAT/PMT/PES framing,
//! PTS, and ADTS framing for AAC.
//!
//! Elementary streams we don't decode (SCTE-35, teletext, DVB subtitles, private
//! data, ...) are carried verbatim, one MoQ track per PID, described in the
//! [`Mpegts`] catalog section. SCTE-35 is just one such stream (`stream_type` 0x86).
//! The service layer rides alongside: the transport/service identity as a
//! [`Program`] record, and the standalone SI tables (SDT, NIT, EIT, ...) as opaque
//! sections on per-`(PID, table_id)` snapshot tracks mapped by [`SiEntry`] and
//! re-emitted on their original PIDs, so the service name, provider, network, and
//! EPG survive the round-trip without anything parsing them. Each SI track group is
//! a complete snapshot (one frame per sub-table, sections concatenated verbatim);
//! frames apply in order with later-wins by sub-table identity, and a joiner reads
//! only the newest group.
