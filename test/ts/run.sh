# MPEG-TS / IRD compliance harness for the moq subscriber's `export ts` output.
#
# It stands up a moq-relay built from this checkout, publishes a PCR-paced
# transport stream (`tsp -P regulate | moq ... import ts`), captures the
# round-tripped stream from a second client (`moq ... export ts`), and runs the
# TSDuck + custom analyzer in compliance.py against the capture. The point is to
# tell whether what the subscriber emits is something an Integrated
# Receiver/Decoder would accept, and to quantify where it diverges (the exporter
# pads to the recorded multiplex rate but never delays media to fit it, and puts a
# PCR every 25 ms of media time).
#
# Modes:
#   ./run.sh                       # generate a clip, round-trip it, analyze
#   ./run.sh --source cap.ts       # round-trip a real capture instead
#   ./run.sh --analyze-only cap.ts # skip the round-trip, just analyze a file
#   ./run.sh --strict              # fail on broadcast-shape warnings too
#   ./run.sh --with-eit            # add a synthetic EPG first, report which SI survived
#   ./run.sh --live                # grade PCR release timing off the live pipe
#   ./run.sh --pair                # two exporters of one broadcast, grade table anchoring
#   ./run.sh --open-gop            # open-GOP clip; its leading pictures must survive
#   ./run.sh --hrd                 # 1080p video filling a broadcast-sized 9 Mbit CPB
#   ./run.sh --headroom            # the same with four audio PIDs, muxed above the video's Rx
#   ./run.sh --delay 1s            # pass the exporter's --delay

# `--live` swaps the analyzer, not the rig. compliance.py grades a captured file
# on the stream's own PCR clock, which is the right basis for the IRD model it
# builds and is why it needs no wall-clock capture -- and also why nothing it
# checks can see *when* the exporter handed the bytes over. pcr-timing.py reads
# the subscriber's stdout a packet at a time and stamps each read, so it grades
# release timing and byte position alongside the values. Nightly runs this arm
# (.github/workflows/nightly.yml); it is not a per-PR gate, because it needs a
# real-time window to measure at all.
#
# `--pair` changes the rig rather than the analyzer: it subscribes twice to one
# broadcast, the second joining late, and grades the two captures against each
# other with table-anchor.py. One exporter cannot show whether a table's emission
# points belong to the broadcast or to the process that happened to be running,
# because there is nothing to disagree with -- so this is the only arm that can
# see a cadence regression at all.
