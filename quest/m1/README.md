# m1: next wave

## Goal

The next wave, in priority order: reliability, new capabilities, performance,
and the planning that settles their shared contracts.

## Plan

Planning and implementation are distinct dispatches: a ready planning quest
produces decisions, fixtures, and rewritten implementation quests, not
speculative production code. Later work waits in [m2](/quest/m2/README.md).

Give one agent ownership of each shared code area at a time (origin/auth, the
JS Reader, audio playback, media containers and archive, bindings, worker
transport, benchmark tooling); worktrees isolate commits, not semantics.

A line with no named consumer waits in m3 until one appears; the 2026-10-05
audit moved P2P, ladder, processor, and timed metadata there from m2.

Decided in the 2026-10-05 audit: the clock chain ranks first (the untimed models,
CMAF frame timestamp, the shared clock, and the two publish-timestamp
quests), with FFI shape pulled up inside it because publishing never invents
a timestamp requires its JSON pilot. The hard fork follows, ahead of perf, and the rest
of the QUIC line follows the fork. Every blocker ranks above the work it
blocks. The quests that gated m0 lines moved under them.

The 2026-10-08 audit moved claim epochs, held group wakes, upstream position
regression, and the audio jitter target line here from m0; moved uring,
capture-chain, and first-FETCH pipelining work to m2; and deleted quests that
were done or not worth their cost.

Promoted from m2 on 2026-10-09 by maintainer priority: mobile capture and
completion, the capacity probe, the viewer up-switch, and native enabled,
which simulcast rung disable requires. Added the same day:
simulcast rung disable, OBS multitrack, MoQ in obs-studio, and portrait
ladders.

Added 2026-10-10: controlled time ranks just above the hard fork, since the
switch, the reliability quests that test on mocked time, and the relay
bench all require its crate.

## Required

- [One max_age meaning](/quest/m1/cache-max-age.md) - a superseded group goes stale on wall clock since its successor arrived or on media time, whichever is first, in Rust and js/net; fixes the untimed failover stall
- [Upstream position regression](/quest/m1/largest-regression.md) - a relay copy that sees upstream's largest group go backwards on moq-transport or epochless lite-07 fails loud instead of serving the old instance's cache
- [Untimed decisions](/quest/m1/untimed-decisions.md) - the maintainer decides whether moq-archive keeps refusing untimed tracks, and whether a malformed FETCH object ends its track
- [Untimed by default in Rust](/quest/m1/rust-untimed-default.md) - an undeclared Rust timescale means untimed, and shared-clock publishers declare milliseconds
- [FFI shape](/quest/m1/ffi-shape/README.md) - the bindings mirror Rust's layers: net at the root, then media, json, flate, audio, and video namespaces built from the handle below
- [Publishing never invents a timestamp](/quest/m1/publish-timestamp.md) - no Rust or binding publish API fills in a timestamp; an untimed payload goes out untimed
- [Controlled time](/quest/m1/time/README.md) - every crate and package reads time through moq-time or @moq/time, and every test runs on a controlled clock; ranks above the fork, whose switch adopts its instant
- [Hard fork](/quest/m1/quic/fork/README.md) - quinn hard-forked in-tree as `moq-quic`, ranked ahead of perf; the rest of the QUIC line follows it
- [Cluster routing](/quest/m1/cluster-routing/README.md) - any node routes toward a broadcast's origin over CDN and P2P links alike, with per-origin routes and path-less announces
- [Flat questlines](/quest/m1/quest-flat-lines.md) - moq pins the current quest CLI, lands its questline branches on main, and retires them
- [main merges through a squash queue](/quest/m1/merge-queue-settings.md) - condition: the maintainer enables the squash merge queue on `main`
- [Binding audio delay](/quest/m1/binding-surface.md) - moq-ffi and every wrapper configure and observe audio playout delay
- [Per-frame arrivals in @moq/watch](/quest/m1/watch-arrivals.md) - the audio and video decoders expose a window of recent frame arrivals, late and skipped marks included, as a signal
- [Bump web-transport-iroh for the capsule close](/quest/m1/iroh-capsule-bump.md) - condition: moq-dev/web-transport#419 ships in a release, then moq's iroh HTTP/3 client reports a peer's close capsule
- [SUBSCRIBE_DROP](/quest/m1/subscribe-drop.md) - every stream group in a lite subscription arrives or is dropped by name, and lite-07 drops its stream count for it
- [lite-07 Live flag](/quest/m1/lite-live.md) - a separate `Live` field on lite-07 SUBSCRIBE, so merged floors never starve a subscriber; late lower groups build on it
- [Subscribe ranges](/quest/m1/subscribe-ranges/README.md) - a lite-07 SUBSCRIBE asks for past and live ranges in either order and replaces FETCH; relays fill misses by range, including over moq-transport
- [Cross-relay bursts re-run](/quest/m1/cross-relay-bursts.md) - condition: the #4349 reporter re-runs their A/B/C comparison against current cdn.moq.pro
- [Untimed lite-07](/quest/m1/lite-untimed.md) - lite-07 carries an untimed track in both languages; lite-05/06 write send time
- [A watch and publish release ships assets()](/quest/m1/assets-release.md) - the release that lets the sites host the worklets
- [Dogfood hosted worklets](/quest/m1/dogfood-assets.md) - the moq.pro dashboard hosts the worklets and calls `assets()` after the release
- [More tests under load](/quest/m1/test-flakes-2/README.md) - the second round of load-only failures, one quest per flake, fixed at the cause
- [Test TypeScript check](/quest/m1/test-ts-check.md) - `just check` type-checks the TypeScript harnesses under test/
- [Release backports, second batch](/quest/m1/release-backports/README.md) - the 0.17.x line picks up the smaller release-only fixes left from the 2026-10-09 triage
- [IETF request headers](/quest/m1/ietf-dispatch-headers.md) - each bidi request reads its header in its own task, so a slow one never blocks the next
- [END_OF_TRACK placement](/quest/m1/ietf-end-of-track-placement.md) - END_OF_TRACK rides the upstream's Location, and Rust's header stops claiming END_OF_GROUP
- [moq-uring tests under load](/quest/m1/uring-tests-under-load.md) - uring tests pass while parallel checks share locked memory
- [FFI runtime](/quest/m1/ffi-runtime.md) - moq-ffi drives moq on a multi-thread runtime instead of one thread
- [Audio group duration](/quest/m1/audio-group-duration.md) - audio groups span at least 20 ms by default, so small frames don't mint a group each
- [Pipelined requests](/quest/m1/pipeline-requests/README.md) - SUBSCRIBE and the first FETCH go out with the track-info request at every hop, so first data arrives a round trip sooner per hop
- [Lazy discovery](/quest/m1/lazy-discovery/README.md) - a `consume` session requests announcements only for prefixes the origin is watching, in JS then Rust; `follow`, `broadcasts`, and the `discovery` option go away
- [A spinning loop fails a sim test](/quest/m1/spinning-loops.md) - a sim test names any loop that holds a task poll too long, and each one yields through a budget
- [A busy js/net serve yields](/quest/m1/js-serve-yield.md) - js/net's serve loop leaves the browser its event loop under a fast publisher, if it does not already
- [Kotlin wrapper POMs](/quest/m1/kt-ffi-pom.md) - Maven builds of `dev.moq:moq` resolve a published moq-ffi instead of the missing `0.0.0-dev`
- [Installable moq-gst](/quest/m1/gst-brew-path.md) - `brew install moq-gst` installs the plugin from the tarball's `lib/gstreamer-1.0/`, and the Nix package carries `x264enc`, `avenc_aac`, and `avdec_h264`
- [Same-epoch importers](/quest/m1/hop-aligned-import.md) - importers sharing one `--epoch` and fed one stream publish identical groups and timestamps, so failover between a redundant pair survives
- [moq.sh deploys from CI](/quest/m1/moq-sh-deploy.md) - the first `release` run of the moq.sh workflow deploys with the Workers Editor token
- [Plan: untimed verbatim PES](/quest/m1/plan-ts-pes-untimed.md) - decide how a verbatim TS track carries a PES that has no PTS, then write the implementation quest
- [Data consumer timestamps](/quest/m1/data-consumer-timestamps.md) - json and binary consumers return each value's timestamp, in Rust and every binding; snapshots add `latest()` beside an in-order `next()`
- [JS data consumer timestamps](/quest/m1/js-data-consumer-timestamps.md) - @moq/json and @moq/flate consumers return each value's timestamp, with snapshot `next()` and `latest()`
- [IETF object gaps](/quest/m1/ietf-object-gaps.md) - a gapped object ID is refused loudly like a subgroup in Rust and JS, and an overflowing one closes the session in Rust
- [JavaScript FETCH](/quest/m1/js-fetch.md) - browser publishers answer IETF FETCH through the JS ranges request surface
- [Relay session limits](/quest/m1/relay-session-limits.md) - moq-relay sets per-session request limits, tighter for clients than peers, and the bindings name a refused request
- [Churn with held subscriptions](/quest/m1/session-churn-held.md) - opening and closing a request costs the same with 1 or 1,024 held subscriptions
- [Catalog track identity](/quest/m1/catalog-tracks.md) - a track's codec and description never change for its name; resolution changes in band below ceilings fixed at creation, and anything else mints a new rendition or epoch
- [Archive](/quest/m1/archive/README.md) - record selected tracks to any object_store and replay them over FETCH or derived HLS; the catalog entry and format may break in place, since no archives exist
- [In-band auth](/quest/m1/auth/README.md) - a session tells its peer what it may publish and subscribe to, unions tokens presented in band, and fails loud on an out-of-scope publish
- [IETF epochs](/quest/m1/ietf-epochs.md) - negotiate explicit broadcast identity on drafts 17-22, retaining unchanged paths and epochless clients on updated relays
- [Claim epochs](/quest/m1/claim-epochs.md) - a lite-07 claim's answer carries its broadcast's epoch, so a worker restarting an output under an unchanged claim route is a new source; moved from m0 on 2026-10-08 since lite-07 is opt-in
- [IETF claim epochs](/quest/m1/ietf-claim-epochs.md) - carry the shared per-output identity in negotiated IETF responses after the extension and lite-07 model land
- [Finalize moq-lite-07](/quest/m1/lite07-finalize.md) - when the maintainer cuts it, lite-07 negotiates as `moq-lite-07` and the next release ships it
- [Dropped sources](/quest/m1/dropped-sources.md) - track consumers see the producer's real error on every end path, never `Dropped`
- [Client settings parity](/quest/m1/obs-client-config.md) - moq-ffi offers moq-c's client knobs, and the OBS Advanced settings get back the ones the C++ migration dropped
- [Session report parity](/quest/m1/obs-session-report.md) - a session reports its negotiated draft and reconnect failures, so the OBS dock shows them again
- [Generated C++ shape](/quest/m1/cpp-generated-shape.md) - `moq::Client` is the generated type itself and `moq::expected` is one type at every C++ standard
- [First C++ package release](/quest/m1/cpp-release.md) - the OBS release path is dry-run nightly, then the first `cpp-v*` tag publishes the C++ archives and the first OBS plugin built on them
- [Catalog switch](/quest/m1/obs-catalog-switch.md) - a catalog update keeps OBS playback running until the replacement track is decoding
- [OBS stats race test](/quest/m1/obs-stats-race.md) - a test against the generated bindings proves a retired session's stats are refused
- [OBS publishes under epochs](/quest/m1/obs-epoch.md) - each OBS Start Streaming is a fresh epoch, through the generated C++
- [Generated C bindings](/quest/m1/c/README.md) - C generated from moq-ffi ships as `moq-c` 0.8.0 and replaces the hand-written libmoq
- [The final libmoq release is the stub](/quest/m1/libmoq-final-release.md) - the release that lets `rs/libmoq` go
- [Retire the libmoq stub](/quest/m1/libmoq-retire.md) - the published `libmoq` crate stops after its final release points users at `moq-c`
- [VideoToolbox presets](/quest/m1/videotoolbox-presets.md) - VideoToolbox honors Balanced and Quality instead of always reporting LowLatency
- [OBS native codecs](/quest/m1/obs-moq-video/README.md) - replace FFmpeg video and audio decoding with moq-video and moq-audio, deliver GPU frames, and use native audio/video encoders
- [OBS multitrack](/quest/m1/obs-multitrack.md) - the obs-moq output publishes OBS's native multitrack video encoders as simulcast renditions, configured like OBS multitrack and over obs-websocket
- [MoQ in obs-studio](/quest/m1/obs-studio/README.md) - a native MoQ output and service merged into obs-studio, once its maintainers agree; the plugin carries it until then
- [AudioToolbox decode](/quest/m1/audio-decode-audiotoolbox.md) - macOS and iOS decode HE-AAC, multichannel AAC, and what else the framework offers
- [AudioToolbox encode](/quest/m1/audio-encode-audiotoolbox.md) - macOS and iOS encode AAC-LC
- [mp4-atom dOps mapping](/quest/m1/mp4-atom-dops-mapping.md) - a released mp4-atom reads and writes any `dOps` channel mapping family and table
- [CMAF surround Opus](/quest/m1/cmaf-opus-surround.md) - fMP4 import and export carry an Opus channel mapping table
- [GPU CI](/quest/m1/gpu-ci.md) - NVIDIA tests run nightly on a self-hosted GPU runner, and `just rs nvidia` runs them locally instead of skipping
- [Rendition preference](/quest/m1/rendition-preference.md) - automatic selection by `<moq-watch>`, `Video::ranked`, and WHEP keeps the highest `preference` that decodes, so a compatibility transcode is only picked when nothing preferred decodes
- [Native enabled](/quest/m1/native-enabled.md) - native players and the ffi/C paths never select a disabled rendition, and move off one disabled mid-playback
- [Simulcast rung disable](/quest/m1/simulcast-rung-disable.md) - JS, Rust/FFI, and OBS publishers stop encoding the top renditions their grant cannot fund, advertise `enabled: false`, and re-enable with hysteresis
- [Discover media headroom](/quest/m1/quic-probe.md) - test useful-media pacing before adding redundant probe traffic
- [Viewer up-switch](/quest/m1/viewer-upswitch.md) - a viewer capped by its small rendition finds headroom through PROBE and moves up
- [Own the QUIC stack](/quest/m1/quic/README.md) - quinn hard-forked in-tree as `moq-quic`, carrying BBR, reliable reset, hierarchical scheduling, peer limits, and endpoint sharding
- [QoS](/quest/m1/qos/README.md) - broadcast health: relay starvation and timeliness histograms
- [Session outcomes](/quest/m1/session-outcomes.md) - the relay's session stats count refusals by reason and ends by kind, per root and tier
- [Typed refusal reason](/quest/m1/refusal-reason.md) - an auth server's 403 names the reason (including `expired`) and the root and tier, so the relay's session outcomes count and attribute refusals
- [Catalog rendition IDs](/quest/m1/catalog-track-id.md) - catalog rendition keys become IDs unique across video and audio, with an optional `track` name, so one catalog lists renditions from several broadcasts
- [Media stats](/quest/m1/stats/README.md) - publishers announce a stats track in the catalog, viewers answer a soliciting catalog through a per-catalog `.echo` broadcast, and one model turns both into a health verdict and a preflight report
- [JS track handover](/quest/m1/js-group-handover.md) - a JS track subscription resumes across a route swap from the first frame it lacks, so `test/drain` passes at zero latency budget
- [Drain handshakes](/quest/m1/drain-handshakes.md) - a drain GOAWAYs and waits for sessions still in their handshake instead of exiting under them
- [Transport upgrade](/quest/m1/transport-upgrade/README.md) - a session that came up over WebSocket moves to QUIC once the QUIC dial lands, handing over without dropping a group
- [Scope track priority](/quest/m1/track-priority-scope.md) - priority orders one owner's streams, and a shared cluster session is fair across tenants
- [BBR ACK cleanup](/quest/m1/bbr-ack-cleanup.md) - packet bookkeeping scales with completed entries instead of scanning the flight on every ACK
- [Benchmark comparisons](/quest/m1/performance-comparisons.md) - retained evidence, repeated paired runs, and uncertainty for performance claims
- [Perf](/quest/m1/perf/README.md) - eliminate measured hot-path costs across moq-uring, kio, and the moq-net model
- [#2924](/quest/m1/2924-moq-relay-tls-rotation-is-not-atomic-across-thread-per.md) - every listener on both runtimes shares one reloadable served identity, so rotation is atomic and generate works with workers
- [Benchmark regressions in CI](/quest/m1/bench-ci.md) - PRs get a non-blocking comparison of the Criterion benches they affect, and a nightly trend on main alerts on regressions
- [Parked-read bench budget](/quest/m1/parked-read-bench-budget.md) - `track_parked_read` completes at default settings instead of expiring its parked reads mid-warm-up
- [Mergeable bench buckets](/quest/m1/bench-buckets.md) - moq-bench emits per-interval latency buckets that sum across processes and hosts
- [Relay session bench](/quest/m1/bench-relay.md) - the same scenario through moq-relay's own connection handling
- [Session burst hang](/quest/m1/session-burst-hang.md) - the burst sweep completes at 16 subscriptions and 16+ groups per round
- [Read-only lookup](/quest/m1/read-only-lookup.md) - a live track lookup stops waking the front and every demand watcher
- [Generated @moq/net](/quest/m1/rs2ts/README.md) - the browser runs moq-net as TypeScript generated from the Rust source, retiring js/net's hand-written protocol and model code
- [Audio jitter target](/quest/m1/audio-jitter-target/README.md) - the playout target is default in both languages; a manual browser proof and a native trace replay remain
- [A/V clock](/quest/m1/av-clock.md) - the audio playhead drives Sync.reference while audio plays, through per-track sync handles
- [Plan: watch worker](/quest/m1/plan-watch-worker.md) - prototype an invisible page worker against app-spawned workers, and land the jank harness that decides
- [Watch worker](/quest/m1/watch-worker.md) - watch playback runs in a worker onto an OffscreenCanvas, so main-thread jank never stalls video or audio
- [Cache expiry growth](/quest/m1/cache-expiry-growth.md) - with the default pool, relay memory plateaus at the expiry window on every version
- [Frame slot charge](/quest/m1/frame-slot-charge.md) - a group's frame slots past the first four count against the cache pool, including capacity a released group keeps
- [Front deadlines](/quest/m1/front-deadline-index.md) - a front's per-event cost stops growing with its track count: an expiry index and per-track wakes, proven by a churn benchmark
- [io_uring handshake deadline](/quest/m1/listener-deadlines.md) - the io_uring workers apply `listen.timeout` to the handshake
- [HTTP listener deadlines](/quest/m1/listener-deadlines-http.md) - the HTTPS and internal listeners drop a connection with no request in flight for `listen.timeout`
- [iroh keep-alive](/quest/m1/iroh-keep-alive.md) - the iroh backend honors `quic.keep_alive`
- [Rust papercuts](/quest/m1/papercuts-rs.md) - HTTP refusals are counted, and a `u64::MAX` resume is unbounded
- [JS papercuts](/quest/m1/papercuts-js.md) - IETF status 0 keeps the subgroup open, a muted rendition change settles, and bad element attributes warn
- [Drop insertTrack](/quest/m1/js-insert-track.md) - `createTrack` is `@moq/net`'s only way to add a track by hand, as in Rust
- [JS subgroup heads race close](/quest/m1/js-head-race.md) - a stalled publisher no longer pins a subgroup reader past unsubscribe
- [Front parking](/quest/m1/origin-front-parks.md) - an unroutable request waits on a front instead of re-asking on every route-table move
- [Route wakes](/quest/m1/route-wakes.md) - a route change wakes only the fronts it can move, so pool churn stops scaling with served paths
- [Publish channel count](/quest/m1/publish-audio-channel-count.md) - forcing a channel count on an Audio.Capture stops costing the subscriber gaps of silence
- [JS request deadline](/quest/m1/js-request-deadline.md) - each JS request, PUBLISH_NAMESPACE included, has one fatal 10 s timer from create to answer and fails fast without stream credit, so nothing queues or retries
- [Rust request credit](/quest/m1/rs-request-credit.md) - a moq-net request fails at once without stream credit instead of waiting
- [qmux no-wait opens](/quest/m1/qmux-no-wait.md) - @moq/qmux rejects an over-limit create when waitUntilAvailable is false, like Chrome

- [Encoder colour](/quest/m1/color-model.md) - every moq-video encode path signals the colour its output actually has, or refuses instead of mislabelling
- [T-STD TS export](/quest/m1/tstd/README.md) - `moq export ts` is a proper remux that passes the T-STD buffer model, starting with a fixed `--delay`
- [Multi-packet PMT](/quest/m1/ts-pmt-split.md) - `export ts` splits a PMT longer than one packet instead of exiting before its first packet
- [ATSC AC-3](/quest/m1/ts-atsc-ac3.md) - `export ts` carries 48 kHz ATSC AC-3 at every A/52 rate up to 640 kb/s instead of aborting from 384 kb/s up

- [WebGPU HDR](/quest/m1/webgpu-hdr.md) - HDR renditions play as HDR where the browser and display can show it, and tone-map to SDR elsewhere
- [Request ID order](/quest/m1/request-id-order.md) - drafts 14 to 16 refuse a reused or lower Request ID in both languages
- [Import catalog drop](/quest/m1/import-catalog-drop.md) - moq-cli import never drops a catalog producer without finishing it
- [WebGPU on Safari](/quest/m1/webgpu-safari.md) - the WebGPU renderer is verified on Safari 26 for macOS and iOS
- [A/V sync across a break](/quest/m1/watch-break-av-sync.md) - `@moq/watch` never plays pre-break audio out of sync with pre-break video
- [moqsrc reconnect](/quest/m1/moqsrc-reconnect.md) - `moqsrc` redials after losing its relay and resumes on the same pads
- [moq fetch closes cleanly](/quest/m1/moq-fetch-close.md) - `moq fetch` closes its session before exiting instead of leaving the relay to time it out
- [Terminal dial errors](/quest/m1/moq-tokio-terminal-errors.md) - moq-tokio's reconnect loop stops on errors that can never succeed
- [Interop close log](/quest/m1/interop-close-log.md) - the interop idle-out check reads the relay close log at a pinned level
