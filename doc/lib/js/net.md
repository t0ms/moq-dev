# @moq/net

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@moq/net)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moq/net)

The TypeScript twin of [`moq-net`](/lib/rs/moq-net): connections, origins,
broadcasts, tracks, groups, and frames, negotiating moq-lite or moq-transport
at setup. The model is [moq-lite](/concept/moq-lite). This page is the behavior
the types do not spell out.

```ts
import * as Moq from "@moq/net";

const url = new URL("https://cdn.moq.dev/anon?jwt=...");

// The origin is the routing table. The broadcast survives a reconnect.
const origin = new Moq.Origin.Producer();
const connection = await Moq.Connection.connect({
    url,
    publish: origin.consume(),
    consume: origin,
});

const broadcast = origin.createBroadcast(Moq.Path.from("chat.room"));
const track = broadcast.createTrack("messages", { timescale: Moq.Time.Timescale.MILLI });
const group = track.appendGroup();
group.writeFrame({ payload: new TextEncoder().encode("hello"), timestamp: Moq.Time.Timestamp.now() });
group.close();
broadcast.announce();
```

- **The origin holds the broadcasts, not the connection.** Closing a session unannounces them and leaves them created for the next one. A broadcast is invisible, locally and remotely, until `announce()`. `dynamic(prefix, route)` claims a prefix and yields each requested path to accept or reject. `accept` throws on a broadcast a session delivered, since JS apps do not proxy; copy its tracks into a broadcast you produce instead.
- **Requests can pin an epoch.** `consumer.request(path, { epoch })` resolves only through a route announcing that [publisher epoch](/concept/moq-lite#publisher-epochs) and reports `unroutable` otherwise. The resolved broadcast's `epoch` names the route it came through, pinned or not.
- **Follow restarts.** `origin.follow(path)` reduces the routes covering a path to the one a request resolves (the most specific) and streams its `start`, `update`, `restart`, and `end`. A `"restart"` says another publisher instance now serves the path: request it again. A request already resolved stays on the old instance, and ends with an `unroutable` error once that instance stops serving: it never moves onto another instance, since without a shared epoch nothing says the new one holds the same bytes. A blind answer (a session without discovery) ends with its session for the same reason, so only announcements can trigger following a restart.
- **One connection per URL, unless you opt out.** `new Connection({ url })` pools and reconnects with backoff, which the elements use. Supplying your own transport options, discovery, or origin selects a private loop.
- **GOAWAY moves the session.** The connection dials the replacement at once while the old session keeps serving its groups, up to `goaway.handover` (default 10s, or the relay's deadline when that is sooner). New requests keep opening on the old session until the replacement's route outranks it, which is a restart without an epoch: a request on the old session ends when that session closes, so request the path again. An empty GOAWAY redials the same URL. A redirect stays on the same host unless `goaway.redirect` is `"follow"`.
- **One send estimate per connection.** `Bandwidth.Allocator` divides it by track priority, max-min fair within a tier. An idle track claims nothing. Publishers reserve against it so their targets sum to the estimate.
- **One track per name.** Concurrent subscriptions share one request and producer. An on-demand producer that replaces an ended one continues the name's group and datagram sequences; only a new broadcast restarts them. `createTrack` and `insertTrack` start at 0.
- **Timing is per track, with no default.** A track that declares a `timescale` carries a `timestamp` on every frame; one without is [untimed](/concept/moq-lite#subscriptions) and its frames carry none. Unlike Rust, omitting it means untimed. Nothing stamps a frame for you: the publisher passes the timestamp, and the `Timed` type (`{ value, at }`) carries one into the `@moq/json` and `@moq/flate` producers.
- **Subscriber staleness is `maxDelay`.** It is media time. Passing the old `maxAge` key throws a `TypeError` naming `maxDelay`. Publisher retention is the separate `Track.Info.maxAge`.
- **Hidden paths** stay out of discovery unless the announce request opts in. See [hidden broadcasts](/concept/moq-lite#hidden-broadcasts).
- **Authorization is in band.** On moq-lite 07 (offered only when `moq-lite-07-wip` is listed in `webtransport.protocols`; the WebSocket fallback cannot offer it) and on moq-transport draft-17+ with the [MoQ Auth extension](/draft/moq-auth), `auth.grant` watches what the relay lets this side publish and subscribe to, and `auth.add(token)` presents another token without reconnecting. Publishing outside the grant closes the connection with `SessionCode.Unauthorized`, naming the path. On moq-lite, a subscription the grant stops covering resets with `StreamCode.Unauthorized` and the session stays up.
- **A graceful close waits.** `await connection.close()` withdraws announcements and gives finished tracks up to one second. `abort()` ends immediately.
