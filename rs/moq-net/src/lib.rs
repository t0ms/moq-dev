//! # moq-net: Media over QUIC networking layer
//!
//! `moq-net` is the networking layer for Media over QUIC: real-time pub/sub with built-in
//! caching, fan-out, and prioritization, on top of QUIC. Sub-second latency at massive scale.
//! At session setup it negotiates one of two wire protocols: the simplified `moq-lite`
//! protocol (the default) or the full IETF `moq-transport` protocol.
//!
//! ## API
//! The API is built around Producer/Consumer pairs, with the hierarchy:
//! - [origin::Consumer]: A collection of [broadcast::Consumer]s, produced by one or more [Session]s.
//! - [broadcast::Consumer]: A collection of [track::Consumer]s, produced by a single publisher.
//! - [track::Consumer]: A collection of [group::Info]s, delivered out-of-order until expired.
//! - [group::Info]: A collection of [frame::Info]s, delivered in order until cancelled.
//! - [frame::Info]: Chunks of data with an upfront size.
//!
//! Each level lives in its own module (`broadcast`, `track`, `group`, `frame`, `origin`,
//! `announce`) that owns the short `Producer` / `Consumer` / `Info` names.
//!
//! Traffic counters for the levels above live in [`stats`]: build a [`stats::Registry`]
//! and hand each session a [`stats::Session`] via [`Client::with_stats`] /
//! [`Server::with_stats`]. Publishing the counters as MoQ broadcasts lives in the
//! `moq-stats` crate.
//!
//! ## Compatibility
//! The API exposes the intersection of features supported by both protocols, intentionally
//! keeping it small rather than polluting it with half-baked features.
//!
//! The library is forwards-compatible with the full IETF specification and supports
//! moq-transport drafts 14+ via version negotiation. Everything will work perfectly,
//! so long as your application uses the API as defined above.
//!
//! For example, there's no concept of "sub-group". When connecting to a moq-transport
//! implementation, we use `sub-group=0` for all frames and silently drop any received
//! frames not in `sub-group=0`. If your application genuinely needs multiple sub-groups,
//! tell me *why* and we can figure something out.
//!
//! ## Producers and Consumers
//! Each level of the hierarchy is split into a Producer / Consumer pair:
//! - The **Producer** is the writer: it appends new state (publishes a broadcast,
//!   starts a group, writes frames, closes a track).
//! - The **Consumer** is a reader: each consumer holds its own independent view
//!   of the producer's state, with its own cursor through the stream.
//!
//! Both halves are cheaply clonable so you can hand out multiple handles. Cloning
//! a consumer creates another reader (each at its own cursor); cloning a producer
//! gives another writer that contributes to the same shared state. Closing the
//! last producer signals consumers that no more updates are coming.
//!
//! ## Driving and time
//! Session and origin drivers never spawn tasks or read the clock.
//! Explicitly minting an [`Epoch`] uses the wall clock and secure randomness. [`Client::connect`] and
//! [`Server::accept`] take an initial [`time::Instant`] and return
//! `(Session, Driver)`. Poll the [`Driver`] with the current instant and a
//! [`kio::Waiter`], then wake on external activity or at the deadline it
//! returns; [`time::run`] does exactly that on tokio or the browser. The last
//! [`Session`] drop requests closure; dropping the driver cancels it.
//!
//! [`origin::Producer::new`] also returns a producer and driver. Its driver runs
//! route changes, serving, linger, teardown, and the origin's cache expiration.
//! Standalone caches expose [`cache::Pool::gc`]. Frame read/write methods
//! clear their expiration timestamp for the next cleanup pass. Datagrams use a bounded
//! FIFO; model read/write APIs take no wall-clock time.
//!
//! Both drivers implement [`time::Driver`]. `moq-uring` drives thread-local
//! transports on its own timer heap. Tests advance time by supplying a later
//! instant.

#![warn(missing_docs)]
// Proving receive futures are Send traverses the shared origin/broadcast/track types.
#![recursion_limit = "256"]
// The browser transport is `!Send`, so on wasm the shared state behind these `Arc`s is
// too and clippy suggests `Rc`. The same code is genuinely cross-thread on native, so
// `Arc` stays and the lint is unactionable here.
