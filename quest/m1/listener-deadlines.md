# [S] io_uring workers bound the handshake

## Goal

The io_uring workers bound a slow handshake the way the default runtime does
after the handshake deadline (moq-dev/moq#4612), by applying
`listen.timeout`.

## Plan

- `rs/moq-relay/src/uring.rs` `serve_connection`: bound the
  WebTransport `Request::accept`, `respond`, and `accept_request_lite` by one
  deadline from `listen::Config::resolved_timeout()`, on the worker's own
  timer (`rs/moq-uring/src/timer.rs`), closing with the timeout code. Delete
  the "There is no timeout here" note in `rs/moq-uring/src/quic/web.rs`, and
  the matching caveat in `doc/bin/relay/config.md`.
- Test on the worker's timer: a stalled handshake closes at the deadline.
  Decided 2026-10-10 from review: this waits for
  [moq-uring on moq-time](/quest/m1/time/uring.md), so the test runs on
  controlled time instead of the private timer heap.

Split on 2026-10-08: the HTTP/2 idle deadline is
[HTTP listener deadlines](/quest/m1/listener-deadlines-http.md) and the iroh
keep-alive is [iroh keep-alive](/quest/m1/iroh-keep-alive.md); each lands on
its own.

Public API: none beyond existing settings. Wire: none.

## Required

- [moq-uring on moq-time](/quest/m1/time/uring.md) - the worker's timer becomes a moq-time backend, so the deadline tests on controlled time
