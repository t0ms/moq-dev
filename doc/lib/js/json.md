# @moq/json

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@moq/json)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@moq/json)

JSON over [`@moq/net`](/lib/js/net) tracks, in three modes. Snapshot and stream
are the catalog modes on the [hang](/concept/hang#data-tracks) page. Window is
a third framing for a raw track: both ends opt into it, and a generic catalog
reader will not pick it up.

- **Snapshot**: lossy latest value, with RFC 7396 merge-patch deltas. A delta before any snapshot is an error. `next()` yields every state in order; `latest()` skips to the newest.
- **Stream**: lossless append-log in a single group. A reader that falls behind fails the read rather than resuming mid-log.
- **Window**: a bounded run of records a reader can join at any point. A new group restates what it keeps explicitly, so a reader that was keeping up is not handed a record twice.

Both sides choose the same compression, `"none"` or `"deflate"`. Producers take
a `Timed` value, `{ value, at }`, where `at` is the capture time written as
the frame timestamp, and the snapshot and stream consumers return the same
shape. Nothing fills in now: a timed track needs `at` on every write, and
an untimed track (no `timescale`) takes none and reads back without one.

```ts
import { Snapshot } from "@moq/json";

// Hold each state back until the video playhead reaches it.
const consumer = new Snapshot.Consumer<Telemetry>({ track });
for await (const { value, at } of consumer) {
    schedule(value, at);
}
```

`next()` buffers every state it has not yielded. On a timed track it skips a
group once the subscription's `maxDelay` proves it stale, and the default of
zero keeps only the newest group, so subscribe with a `maxDelay` covering how
far the playhead trails the live edge. An untimed track skips nothing; a reader
that cannot keep up calls `latest()` instead.

A stream rides one group, so the whole log shares `@moq/net`'s group budget:
32 MiB of payload and 8192 records. An append that might not fit is refused
before anything is written and leaves the log intact. Once the budget is spent,
start a new track. Any other failed append aborts the track, so readers see
the error rather than a log that looks complete.

The Rust twin is [`moq-json`](/lib/rs/moq-json).
