# [M] lite-07 Live flag

## Goal

Subscribers with different group and frame floors that share one upstream
subscription, in-process or through a relay, each receive everything their own
floor and `Subscriber Max Age` allow. No subscriber's floor starves another:
a resumed subscriber whose floor sits above the live edge never hides the
latest group from a subscriber that wants it.

Today a floor and "no floor" are one field. On lite-06 `Group Start` 0 means no
floor, and the model keeps a separate `None` from pre-06's "absent means the
latest group". Merging an explicit floor with `None` either drops the late
group the floor asked for (main) or starves the floorless subscriber until the
floor's group exists, which on a quiet catalog track is never (#5000, the
failure #4940 fixed from the other side).

## Plan

Decided (maintainer, 2026-10-07):

- lite-07 SUBSCRIBE and SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE carry a separate `Live` boolean.
  `Group Start` and `Frame Start` become a plain absolute floor, with no
  "0 means none" sentinel.
- A live-only subscriber has no floor, the neutral value for the minimum, so
  lite-07 makes the floor optional. A subscription with neither a floor nor
  `Live` is refused. The draft names how an absent floor is encoded (not a
  value-plus-one sentinel) and how SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE clears a floor or `Live`.
- `Live: true` lowers the floor to frame 0 of the oldest group that
  `Subscriber Max Age` has not expired, when that position sorts below the
  floor. That is the start lite-06 already resolves for `Group Start` 0, so a
  buffering subscriber keeps its backlog, and a max age of 0 still means the
  latest group. On an untimed track the wall clock alone judges staleness
  ([One max_age meaning](/quest/m1/cache-max-age.md)), so `Live` starts at
  the oldest group that isn't stale there too; until that lands it means the
  latest group (as `model/subscription.rs` documents today). Comparing
  positions, not groups, means a merged floor of (3, 5) with group 3 as the
  latest still delivers frames 0-4.
- [Model ranges](/quest/m1/subscribe-ranges/model.md) replaces the floor
  with ranges after this lands: the floor becomes the lowest range start, and
  `Live` stays its own flag.
- The model mirrors the wire: `Subscription { floor: Option<(group, frame)>,
  live }` in Rust and `@moq/net`.
- Merging across subscribers (`Subscription::poll_combined`, JS
  `combineSubscriptions`): `live` is the OR, and the floor is the minimum
  `(group, frame)`. Each subscriber's own cursor still filters what it sees.
- Older wires map at the codec only, with no change to a published version:
  lite-06 `Group Start` 0 with `Frame Start` 0 is `live`, any other pair a
  floor (`(0, N)` is a catalog resume); pre-06 absent is `live`.
  moq-transport has no current-group filter, so `live` is the bridge
  `ietf::subscriber::subscribe_join` already sends: `Largest Object` plus the
  current group's prefix, from a `Relative(1)` fill on draft-20+ or a relative
  joining FETCH on older drafts. `Next Group Start` (draft-20 `Relative(0)`)
  keeps its draft meaning, a floor at the group after Largest Object; a bare
  `Largest Object` is a floor at the next object; draft-20 `Relative(1)` is
  `live`; `Absolute Start` is a floor.
- When merged subscriptions need both `live` and a floor that an older
  upstream wire cannot express in one SUBSCRIBE, a moq-transport upstream is
  subscribed from `Absolute Start` at group 0, and the relay filters locally
  by age and floor. The relay can't learn the oldest unexpired group
  upstream: the ordinary join (`subscribe_join`) fetches only the latest
  group's prefix. Decided 2026-10-08: no TRACK_STATUS step to find the
  largest group first, since it covers only an unbuffered `live` and adds a
  round trip. For an empty track the `live` mapping alone covers both, since
  moq-transport starts it at {0, 0}. moq-lite has no
  TRACK_STATUS, so a lite-06 or lite-03 to 05 upstream is subscribed at floor
  0 and the relay filters locally. On lite-06 that is `Group Start` 0, exactly
  the `live` mapping. On lite-03 to 05 the floor must go out as an explicit
  group 0 (replay from the beginning): the codec folds a floor of 0 to absent
  today (`encode_start_group`), which those versions read as the latest
  group, so a merged `{floor: 2, live}` with groups 2-4 retained would lose
  2-3. lite-01 and 02 carry no `Group Start` at all, so a merged floor through
  them gets what they send from the latest group; that is a limitation of
  those published versions, not something the codec can fix.
- Docs stay inline: the lite draft (field, semantics, lite-07 changelog),
  `doc/concept`, and the Rust and JS API docs.

Test with mock time: the starvation case (a floor-4 subscriber and a `live`
subscriber on a quiet track whose newest group is 3) in-process and through a
relay on lite-06 and lite-07-wip, a buffering `live` subscriber (max age > 0)
merged with a floor above the live edge, a frame floor merged with `live`, a
merged `{floor: 2, live}` through a lite-03 to 05 upstream with groups 2-4
retained that delivers all three, a buffered `live` merged with a floor-5
subscriber over a moq-transport upstream with fresh groups 2-4 that still
delivers 2-4, an untimed `live` merged with a floor, and the codec mapping
of each older wire. Also the mixed case #5000 left out: through a lite-05
relay, a `live` subscriber already reading group 1, then one with a floor of
group 0, and a fresh group 0 reaches only the second.
