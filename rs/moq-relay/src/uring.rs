//! Serving QUIC from io_uring workers.
//!
//! The [`moq_uring`] counterpart of [`moq_tokio::worker`]: one pinned thread
//! per worker, each with its own ring, its own `SO_REUSEPORT` socket steered
//! by connection id ([`moq_sock::shard`]), and its own
//! [`moq_uring::quic::Endpoint`] serving browsers (WebTransport over `h3`)
//! and native peers (raw QUIC, moq-lite ALPNs) alike. Sessions are moq-lite
//! only.
//!
//! The split of work mirrors the relay's topology: a worker owns everything
//! transport-shaped (the handshake, the session's protocol machine), while
//! authentication and session supervision run on the shared tokio runtime,
//! which owns the HTTP client, the timers, and the origins. The session
//! handle is `Send + Sync` whatever drives its transport, which is what makes
//! the handoff free.
