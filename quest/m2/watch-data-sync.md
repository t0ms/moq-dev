# [M] js/watch: play data tracks in sync with media

## Goal

A browser viewer receives JSON and binary track payloads on the same playhead
as the video and audio it plays, so telemetry shown beside a frame describes
that frame. A data track whose advertised `delay` and `jitter` exceed the
media's holds the media back by that much, and dropping the data track
releases it.

## Plan

- A `js/watch` data-track reader subscribes a catalog JSON or binary entry
  (built-in section or an application section embedding the config), releases
  each payload when the playhead reaches its frame timestamp, and registers its
  `delay` and `jitter` with `Sync` like a media rendition.
- Snapshot tracks release the newest state at or before the playhead, picked
  from the in-order states the consumer yields; stream tracks release every
  record in order.
- An untimed track's payloads add no timestamp wait; they apply in order as
  they arrive. Since 2026-10-05 a track is all timed or all untimed (the untimed
  model, [#4822](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/4822)), so no stream mixes the two.
- This replaces the sync code a web frontend writes today to hold KLV or
  MAVLink telemetry back to the video playhead. In m2 rather than m1, since
  that workaround exists.
- Decided 2026-10-08: the A/V clock and the watch worker land first, since
  they change what `Sync` waits on and where it runs.

## Required

- [A/V clock](/quest/m1/av-clock.md) - the playhead the reader releases against
- [Watch worker](/quest/m1/watch-worker.md) - moves `Sync` into a worker, where the reader registers
