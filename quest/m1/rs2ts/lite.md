# [XL] Generated lite

## Goal

@moq/net's lite session and model layer are generated from moq-net by rs2ts,
and the hand-written TypeScript they replace is deleted. Hand-written
TypeScript remains only for the transport pumps, timers, and the Promise
helpers over the poll API. The translated moq-net tests and
`just test interop --all` pass. The translator's bundle-size and per-frame
CPU go/no-go still gates this implementation; the final browser comparison
is a separate follow-up.

## Plan

Decided in the 2026-10-10 audit: the
[final browser report](/quest/m2/rs2ts-browser-report.md) belongs in m2 with
its harness. Keep implementation measurements and the translator's go/no-go
here; do not wait for that broader report to land generated lite.

- The `@moq/net` API may change where the generated shape is no worse to
  use: disposable handles (`using`), `U64` for sequences and ids. Update
  watch, publish, hang, room, and the demos in the same change, and the
  `doc/` pages for anything user-facing.
- A forgotten `drop()` leaves a track open forever: add a debug-only
  `FinalizationRegistry` that reports handles collected without one, and
  runtime guards against double drop and use after drop.
- Size budget: js/net's `lite/*` is 15 KB gzip today; keep generated output
  near it. Watch for std shims and fmt/tracing pulling in weight.

Public API: breaks `@moq/net`. Wire: none.

## Required

- [rs2ts](/quest/m1/rs2ts/translator.md) - the translator
- [Sans-IO lite session](/quest/m1/rs2ts/sans-io/lite.md) - the session shape it translates
- [The async feature](/quest/m1/rs2ts/sans-io/async-feature.md) - rs2ts reads moq-net without it
