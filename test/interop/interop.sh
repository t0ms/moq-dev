# Cross-language media interop test against THIS checkout.
#
# Unlike the standalone moq-dev/smoke repo (which installs each client from its
# public registry to catch packaging breakage), this builds every client from
# the workspace source. It proves the code in the tree interoperates across
# implementations before anything is published: a relay built from rs/moq-relay,
# clients built from rs/moq-cli, py/, go/, cpp/moq, js/, and rs/moq-c, all
# talking to each other. There's no apt/brew/npm/PyPI here, just
# cargo/bun/uv/go/cmake/cc.
#
# It stands up a moq-relay, then for each publisher language publishes an H.264
# broadcast and confirms every subscriber sees data flowing before the timeout.
# Every publisher but the Rust CLI also carries audio. The browser subscriber
# verifies rendered WebCodecs output, player pause/resume, and that audio, then
# that a session the relay refuses hands Chromium the close code and reason.
#
# Every client dials with a token minted for its cell and verified by
# `moq auth serve`. Clients that print the grant the relay sent back over AUTH
# must report exactly what their token implies, and a final round per enforcing
# publisher mints a token that excludes its broadcast: the publisher must fail
# loud with Unauthorized and no subscriber may see data. AUTH is only on the
# work-in-progress moq-lite-07, so those clients dial it alone while the rest keep
# their defaults, and the matrix also crosses versions through the relay.
