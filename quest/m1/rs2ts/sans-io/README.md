# Sans-IO moq-net

## Goal

moq-net builds and runs with no async runtime: bytes and timestamps go in,
events and bytes come out. The async helper methods sit behind an `async`
cargo feature, and a CI lane builds and tests the crate without it.

## Plan

Decided in planning: moq-net itself is the core, not a second crate. JS
reimplements the async helpers natively with Promises, so the translator
reads the crate without the `async` feature. Split by layer so each lands
independently.

The line has no work of its own beyond its children. Decided in the
2026-09-30 audit: the IETF session moved to m2 with the rest of the IETF
half; this line is lite and the model only.

## Required

- [Sans-IO lite session](/quest/m1/rs2ts/sans-io/lite.md) - the lite session is driven by bytes, stream events, and `tick(now)`
- [The async feature](/quest/m1/rs2ts/sans-io/async-feature.md) - the async helpers sit behind an `async` feature and a CI lane builds and tests moq-net without it

## Related

- [Sans-IO IETF session](/quest/m2/rs2ts-sans-io-ietf.md) - the moq-transport session, deferred to m2
- [Controlled time](/quest/m1/time/README.md) - ambient time stays behind the `async` feature; the core takes explicit instants
