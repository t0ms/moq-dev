# [M] Benchmark regressions in CI

## Goal

A pull request that touches a benched Rust crate, or anything it depends on,
gets a sticky comment comparing its Criterion benchmarks against the base. The
comment never fails the PR. A nightly run on `main` keeps a history of every
benchmark and fails when one regresses past a loose threshold against the
previous nightly's commit measured on the same runner, so the existing Alert
workflow posts it to Discord.

Rust Criterion targets only. Browser and JS benchmarks stay with
[Browser benchmarks](/quest/m2/browser-benchmarks.md), and relay load stays
local under `just bench BASE`.

## Plan

Researched 2026-09: CodSpeed's instruction counting skips every
`iter_custom` bench (all of `moq-uring`, plus `moq-net` origin and track) and
can't see syscall time. Bencher compares a PR against history recorded on other
VMs, so its thresholds fire on runner noise. The chosen shape, free and without
a GitHub App:

- PR: one job builds base and head on the same runner and runs only the
  selected targets, saving and comparing Criterion baselines. Selection is the
  changed crates plus their dependents, from the impact map in
  `sh/dispatch.sh`. No selected bench
  means no job. Extend `bench/run.sh` with a Criterion-only, crate-scoped mode
  behind a recipe instead of writing a second runner. Hosted runners vary by
  about 3%, so the comment highlights only changes Criterion calls
  significant and beyond a noise floor you choose from A/A runs. Fork PRs
  have a read-only token, so posting needs a `workflow_run` follow-up.
- Nightly: build the previous nightly's commit beside `main` on the same
  runner and fail only on that paired comparison. Each hosted run is a fresh
  VM, so the cross-run history is subject to the same noise as Bencher and
  stays informational: record it with
  [github-action-benchmark](https://github.com/benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark)
  on a data branch, with its own alert disabled. The `moq-uring` socket
  benches run only here, and skip loudly when the runner's kernel is too old. Add the workflow's name to
  `alert.yml` if it isn't `Nightly`.
- Validate with an A/A run (the same commit twice) and a deliberately slowed
  bench before trusting either signal.
- Document the comment, the trend, and local reproduction in
  `bench/README.md`.
