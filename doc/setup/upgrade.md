description: Breaking changes between the 2026-09-17 releases and the 2026-09-23 release train, with the replacement for each
---

# Upgrade

This page walks from the 2026-09-17 releases (moq-relay 0.14.18, moq-cli
0.11.2, moq-net 0.2.22, @moq/net 0.3.5, moq-ffi 0.3.19) to the 2026-09-23
release train (moq-relay 0.15.1, moq-cli 0.12.1, moq-net 0.3.0, @moq/net 0.4.0,
moq-ffi 0.4.1). Each crate's `CHANGELOG.md` has the full list; this page is the
subset that breaks a working setup.

A released flag, environment variable, or config key that was renamed is
refused at startup with its replacement named, rather than ignored. Fix what the
error lists and rerun.

## Unreleased

These land with the next breaking release, not the 2026-09-23 train.

- **A replaced broadcast restarts announce consumers, and subscriptions stay.**
  Rust's `AnnounceEvent` gains `Restart`, `@moq/net`'s announce events gain the
  `"restart"` kind, moq-ffi's `MoqAnnounceEvent` gains `Restart`, and libmoq's
  `moq_announce_kind` gains `MOQ_ANNOUNCE_KIND_RESTART`: another publisher
  instance now serves the prefix (a newer epoch, or another route without one,
  including a reconnect), so request the path again. A newer epoch no longer
  ends subscriptions with `Unroutable`; they stay on the old instance until
  dropped or its route goes. A restart was an end then a start, and still is on
  moq-lite 06 and older and moq-transport. moq-lite 07 adds `ANNOUNCE_RESTART`
  (0x3), and lite-06's `ANNOUNCE_RESTART` is named `ANNOUNCE_UPDATE`, as it
  always meant.
- **`moq export ts --linger` waits only for the same publisher instance.** A
  restarted publisher (a new epoch, or any return on a version without one)
  exits 1 unless `--stitch` follows it as a program switch. `export srt` takes
  the same two flags. In Rust, moq-mux's `ts::Export::resume` is
  `ts::Export::follow`, `Source::returned` is gone, and `ts::Follower` follows a
  path's announcements the way both exports do.
- **fMP4 export of Annex-B H.264 and H.265 inits from the catalog.** When the
  catalog codec string and dimensions are enough, `moq export fmp4` writes an
  `avc3` or `hev1` init segment before the first keyframe and leaves SPS, PPS,
  and VPS in the samples. High AVC profiles (110, 122, 244, and the rest whose
  chroma or bit depth the string does not carry), HEVC beyond Main and Main
  Still Picture, and a catalog missing dimensions still wait for the SPS. A
  returning Annex-B rendition is matched on that catalog record, so an encoder
  that restarts with a new SPS can return. A keyframe whose parameter sets never
  appeared in the track ends the export instead of waiting 30 seconds.
- **moq-binary is moq-flate, and @moq/binary is @moq/flate.** The opaque
  `snapshot` and `stream` tracks moved beside the codec; the wire and the
  catalog's `binary` section are unchanged. In Rust, `moq_binary::X` is
  `moq_flate::X`, and `moq_binary::Error::Flate(e)` is the matching
  `moq_flate::Error` variant (`Decompress`, `TooLarge`). `moq_flate::Error`
  now carries `moq_net::Error`, so it is no longer `PartialEq`. moq-mux's
  `Error::Binary` is `Error::Flate`. In TypeScript, import `Snapshot` and
  `Stream` from `@moq/flate`.
- **moq-ffi data tracks wrap a track.** The broadcast's
  `publish_binary_*`, `publish_json_*`, and `subscribe_json_*` are gone.
  Create the track with `publish_track` or `subscribe_track`, then construct
  `MoqFlateSnapshotProducer` / `MoqFlateStreamProducer` (taking
  `MoqFlateConfig`) or `MoqJsonSnapshotProducer` / `MoqJsonStreamProducer`
  from the broadcast and the track, or `MoqJsonSnapshotConsumer` /
  `MoqJsonStreamConsumer` from the track. The wrappers keep JSON under its own
  namespace: `moq.json` in Python, `moq.dev/moq/json` in Go, `dev.moq.json` in
  Kotlin, `package:moq/json.dart` in Dart, and `Json` in Swift. The C
  `moq_publish_binary_*` calls are unchanged.
- **moq-ffi clients and servers take a config record.** `MoqClient::new()` and
  `MoqServer::new()` plus their setters are `MoqClient::new(MoqClientConfig)` and
  `MoqServer::new(MoqServerConfig)`, with nested `tls`, `quic`, `websocket`, and
  `backoff` records and a new `versions` list. A value the native side cannot use
  fails construction with `MoqError::Config`, including a bad bind address that
  used to fail later as `Bind`. The `subscribe` origin is `consume` everywhere:
  Python's `Client(..., subscribe=)` is `consume=`, Go's `WithSubscribeOrigin` is
  `WithConsumeOrigin`. A server request's `set_publish` / `set_consume` are
  arguments to `accept(publish, consume)`, where null inherits the server's
  origin (Go: `Accept(ctx, nil, nil)`). Go's `Requests(ctx)` iterators are
  `All(ctx)`, and its `Status*` constants are `ConnectionStatus*`; Kotlin and
  Dart read announcements as `announced(config).updates()`.
- **moq-ffi media lives in a `media` namespace.** The broadcast's
  `publish_audio`, `publish_video`, `publish_container`, their `_on_track` and
  `_stream` variants, `set_video_properties`, `set_catalog_section`,
  `subscribe_catalog`, `subscribe_media`, and `fetch_media_group` are gone.
  Construct `MoqMediaTrackProducer::audio` / `video` (from the broadcast, a
  `MoqMediaTarget::Named` or `Requested` target, and the init record),
  `MoqMediaContainerProducer`, `MoqMediaCatalogProducer`,
  `MoqMediaCatalogConsumer::subscribe`, `MoqMediaContainerConsumer::subscribe`,
  or `MoqMediaContainerGroupConsumer::fetch` instead. Producers drop `name`,
  `used`, and `unused`; read them through `demand()`. The wrappers expose these
  as `moq.media` in Python, `moq.dev/moq/media` in Go, `dev.moq.media` in
  Kotlin, `package:moq/media.dart` in Dart, and `Media` in Swift.
- **Python and Go durations are native.** `Frame`, `Datagram`, `Subscription`,
  `TrackInfo`, and `ConnectionStats` carry `timedelta` in Python and
  `time.Duration` in Go instead of microsecond integers: `max_delay_us` is
  `max_delay`, `timestamp_us` is `timestamp`, and `rtt_us` is `rtt`. A frame
  timestamp read from an untimed track is `None` / `nil`. A Python string
  passed where a list of strings belongs (`tls_roots="ca.pem"`) raises
  `TypeError` instead of splitting into characters.
- **Demand is read through `demand()`.** In Rust, `track::Producer`'s
  `is_used`, `used`, `unused`, and `poll_unused` are `producer.demand().X`,
  and so are `group::Producer`'s `used` and `unused`.
  `track::Request::poll_unused`, `track::Dynamic::poll_unused`, and
  `group::Request::poll_unused` are `demand().poll_unused`, which returns
  `Poll<Result<()>>` instead of `Poll<()>`: an `Err` means the request closed,
  so treat it as unused too. A `group::Request` no longer needs polling to be
  withdrawn; the last `fetch_group` caller leaving does it, so a handler that
  sees it unused just drops it. A fetch arriving after that queues a fresh
  request instead of joining the abandoned one, so a handler that keeps serving
  without watching `demand()` may see its `accept` return `Error::Duplicate`.
  The moq-json snapshot and moq-flate `is_used()` is `demand().is_used()`.
  In TypeScript, `Track.Producer`'s `used` and `unused()` are
  `producer.demand().used` and `.unused()`, as are `Group.Producer`'s, and
  `Allocator.reserve` takes `producer.demand()`, replacing the
  `Bandwidth.Demand` interface.
- **`request_broadcast` takes an epoch.** In Rust,
  `origin::Consumer::request_broadcast(path)` is
  `request_broadcast(path, None)`; pass an `Epoch` instead to refuse any other
  publisher instance. In TypeScript, `RequestOptions.epoch` does the same. A
  dynamic route updated to another epoch now refuses the requests its handler
  still holds with `Unroutable`, so a handler answering them late sees its
  answer dropped.
- **`moq --hop` is removed; `--epoch` replaces it.** A redundant pair shares an
  epoch, a UUIDv7 such as `uuidgen -7` prints, instead of a Hop ID: pass the
  same `--epoch` (or `MOQ_EPOCH`) to both. Unlike a rename, `--hop` is now an
  unknown flag and `MOQ_HOP` is silently ignored, so remove it from any
  deployment: a pair still keyed on `MOQ_HOP` mints an epoch per process, and
  whenever either member starts or restarts, its new epoch replaces the other's
  broadcast and restarts its viewers. `--cluster-id` no longer falls
  back to `--hop`, so a node that pinned its Hop ID with `--hop` passes
  `--cluster-id`. Relays no longer put a random hop in front of a route that
  names no publisher; it keeps its 0.
- **The `"auto"` delay is measured, not derived from RTT** (#4162). It is sized
  from how late frames arrive (see [audio jitter](/concept/audio-jitter)) in
  `@moq/watch` and `moq play`, which now defaults `--delay` to `auto` instead of
  `100ms`. A numeric `@moq/watch` delay is taken literally instead of having
  the rendition's own delay added on top. `Sync.out.jitter` now always
  equals `Sync.out.delay`, and `"auto"` with no decoder registered resolves to
  0 rather than 100 ms.
- **`moq export ts --delay` replaces `--max-age`** (#4645). Each frame is
  written that long after its decode time, on a clock that follows the
  source's; `--max-age` and `--latency-max` are refused with the new flag
  named. In Rust, moq-mux's `ts::Export::with_max_age` is `with_delay`, and
  `ts::stats::Export` gains the dropped-frame count (late frames, and the
  video frames then dropped waiting for a keyframe), measured drift and
  out-of-tolerance count beside its `streams` rows. It is no longer `Eq`.
- **moq-mux has no clock translators.** `clock::Anchor`, `clock::Lane`, and
  `SourceMap` (#4667) are gone, along with the importers' `live()`. Publish the
  source's own timestamps and let the catalog clock map them to wall time.
  An importer whose first frame arrives once the clock is in use (taken with
  `catalog.clock()`, published in a catalog, or pinned with
  `Config::with_clock`) shifts its timestamps onto it, so its first frame lands
  at now; a `with_clock` catalog no longer keeps an importer's timestamps
  verbatim. Importers sharing a timestamp base reserve through one
  `catalog.timebase()`.
- **moq-net owns its transport traits.** `moq_net::web_transport_trait` is
  gone, and `transport::poll::{Session, SendStream, RecvStream}` no longer
  extend `web_transport_trait::poll`. They carry their own `poll_*` methods,
  `transport::Error`, and `transport::Stats`, and `Error::from_transport` takes
  a `transport::Error`. moq-tokio's `Client` and `Server` are unchanged. A
  custom transport handed straight to moq-net implements these traits; a
  `moq-uring` session is wrapped with `moq_uring::transport::Session::new`.
- **`--cluster-mesh` and `--cluster-linger` are unknown flags.** moq-relay
  0.17 refuses them by name; later relays reject them, and TOML `mesh` and
  `linger`, like any unknown setting. `MOQ_CLUSTER_MESH` and
  `MOQ_CLUSTER_LINGER` are no longer read, so drop them from the environment.
  In Rust, `cluster::Config` has no `mesh` or `linger` field.
- **Settings no listener reads stop startup.** A stream-only relay or `moq`
  listener (TCP or Unix, no `--listen`) refuses the QUIC-only
  `--listen-preferred-v4`/`-v6`, `--listen-quic-lb-id`, and pinned `tls.peers`,
  and a `--listen-tls-cert`, `-key`, or `-generate` unless `--listen-tcp-tls`
  serves it. `--listen-unix-allow-*` needs `--listen-unix-bind`, and
  `web.https.cert`, `key`, and `root` need `web.https.listen`. `moq` without a
  listener refuses `--listen-*` and `--auth-*` flags. Each used to be ignored;
  drop it, or add the listener it configures.
- **moq-mux data producers take a broadcast-clock `Timestamp`.** `json` and
  `binary` `Snapshot::update` and `Stream::append` take `Timed<_, Timestamp>`
  instead of `Timed<_, Instant>`, and publish it as given. Convert a capture
  `Instant` with `.at(catalog.clock().capture(instant)?)`. A timestamp ahead
  of now is published rather than refused.
- **moq-mux importers publish the catalog at their first frame.** The fMP4,
  MKV, and MPEG-TS importers used to publish it at their init segment (`moov`,
  `Tracks`, or the first PMT) on a provisional clock, then re-anchor it on the
  first frame. They now hold it until that frame, as FLV already did, so the
  first snapshot carries the final root `clock`. A reader waiting for the
  catalog now waits for media of a selected track, not just the init segment:
  a track `with_select` deselects doesn't release it, even if its media
  arrives first. A `moov` or `Tracks` decoded after `finish()` is refused with
  `fmp4::Error::MoovAfterFinish` or `mkv::Error::TracksAfterFinish`, since the
  tracks it declares could never finish.
- **fMP4 export fixes its track set at the init segment.** moq-mux's
  `fmp4::Error` drops `MissingVideoTrack`, `MissingAudioTrack`, and
  `NoCatalogSnapshot`, and adds `TrackAdded`, `TrackChanged`, `TrackRewound`,
  and `TrackUndescribed`. `fmp4::Export` and `moq export fmp4` now end with one
  of these where they used to write a track missing from the moov, and a
  broadcast that ends with media queued behind an undescribed track is an error
  rather than an empty `Ok(None)`. Restart the export to pick up a new
  rendition.
- **Subscriber staleness is max delay.** How far a group may fall behind the
  live edge before a subscriber skips it is now `max_delay`, so it no longer
  shares a name with a publisher's retention, which keeps `max_age`. In Rust,
  `track::Subscription::max_age` and `with_max_age` are `max_delay` and
  `with_max_delay`; moq-mux's `container::Consumer::set_max_age` and the fMP4,
  MKV, FLV, H.264, and H.265 exports' `with_max_age` are `set_max_delay` and
  `with_max_delay`; moq-audio's and moq-video's `decode::Options::max_age` is
  `max_delay`, as is moq-audio's `decode::Consumer::max_age()`; and moq-rtmp's
  `Play::with_max_age`, `Client::with_export_max_age`,
  `listen::Config::export_max_age`, and `DEFAULT_MAX_AGE` are `with_max_delay`,
  `with_export_max_delay`, `export_max_delay`, and `DEFAULT_MAX_DELAY`. In
  TypeScript, `Track.Subscription`'s `maxAge` is `maxDelay`, as are
  `Container.Consumer`'s `maxAge` prop and `@moq/watch`'s `Sync.out.maxAge`;
  JavaScript refuses a `maxAge` key in subscription options or container consumer
  props with a `TypeError` naming `maxDelay`, including when both keys are supplied
  or `maxAge` is `undefined`. Untyped callers must rename it.
  moq-ffi's `MoqSubscription`, `MoqAudioDecoderOutput`, and
  `MoqVideoDecoderOutput` take `max_delay_us` (each binding in its own casing),
  and so do C's `moq_subscription`, `moq_audio_decoder_output`,
  `moq_video_decoder_output`, `moq_consume_video`, and `moq_consume_audio`.
  `moq export fmp4`, `mkv`, `flv`, `h264`, `h265`, and `rtmp` take
  `--max-delay`, and refuse `--max-age`. `track::Info::max_age`,
  `MoqTrackInfo.max_age_us`, and `moq import --max-age` are unchanged, as is the wire.
- **moq-relay auth takes the client-CA answer.** `auth::Config::validate` and
  `init` take `client_ca: bool`, whether any listener verifies client
  certificates, and `validate_client_ca` is gone. `moq --listen` with an
  invalid auth config stops at startup instead of refusing every session.
- **A client CA needs a QUIC listener.** A stream-only relay or `moq` listener
  (TCP or Unix, no `--listen`) refuses to start with `listen.tls.root`, which
  nothing verified; moq-tokio returns `Error::MtlsUnsupported` for it.
- **moq-tokio's `Transport` names WebTransport.** `moq_tokio::server::Transport`
  is `moq_tokio::Transport`, with no re-export. A WebTransport session reports
  `Transport::WebTransport` (`"webtransport"` in logs) instead of `Quic`, which
  now means raw QUIC only, and `Connection::transport()` reports the live
  transport. The bindings' `MoqTransport` gains a `WebTransport` case, so an
  exhaustive `switch` or `when` needs one more arm.
- **moq-net has no `VarInt`.** Varints are plain `u64`s:
  `VarInt::decode_quic(buf)?.into_inner()` is `moq_net::varint::decode_quic(buf)?`,
  and `VarInt::try_from(v)?.encode_quic(buf)` is
  `moq_net::varint::encode_quic(v, buf)`, which fails past
  `varint::MAX_QUIC` (2^62 - 1).
- **Opus mapping family lives only on `mapping`.**
  `moq_mux::codec::opus::Config::mapping_family` is gone. Family 0 is
  `mapping: None`; any other family is the mapping's own (`mapping.family()`).
  Set `mapping` alone when building a surround head. The OpusHead bytes are
  unchanged.
- **moq-mux TS stats live in `ts::stats`.** `ts::Stats` is
  `ts::stats::Snapshot` and `ts::StreamStats` is `ts::stats::Stream`, whose
  `track` is an owned `String`. `ts::Export::stats` returns
  `ts::stats::Export`; feed it to `stats::Log` with `.into()`. `ts::MultipleProgramsError` is
  `#[non_exhaustive]`: recover it by downcast and read `programs`.
- **@moq/publish drops `OpusConfig.usedtx`.** Chromium's DTX output shifts the
  audio timeline, so Opus DTX is always off (the WebCodecs default). Remove the
  field; a plain-JS caller still passing it is ignored.
- **FLV export takes a catalog stream.** `flv::Export::new` is synchronous and
  takes `(source, catalog)`, like `fmp4::Export` and `mkv::Export`.
  `with_catalog_format` and `with_select` are gone. Open the catalog yourself
  (`source.catalog(format)`) and narrow it with `catalog::Stream::select`
  before constructing the export. `moq export flv` still applies the same
  rendition flags.
- **A track is timed or untimed, and nothing fills in a timestamp on
  receive.** An untimed track (no timescale) arrives untimed, except over
  moq-lite 05 and later, which can't encode absence yet and carry a send time
  instead; see [untimed tracks](/concept/moq-lite#subscriptions). A write whose
  timedness doesn't match its track fails with `TimestampMismatch`.
  - moq-net: `track::Info.timescale` is `Option<Timescale>`, `None` for an
    untimed track (`with_timescale` takes `impl Into<Option<_>>`), and
    `group::{Producer,Consumer}::timescale()` return `Option<Timescale>`.
    `Frame.timestamp`, `frame::Info.timestamp`, and `Datagram.timestamp` are
    `Option<Timestamp>`. The `write_frame`, `append_datagram`, and
    `insert_datagram` calls take `impl Into<Option<Timestamp>>`, so passing a
    `Timestamp` still compiles.
  - moq-e2ee: `Frame` and `Datagram` timestamps are optional, and its writers
    take `impl Into<Option<Timestamp>>`.
  - moq-archive: recording an untimed track fails with `Error::Untimed`, so
    `moq export archive` over moq-lite before 05 or moq-transport drafts
    14–16 now fails instead of recording arrival times.
  - moq-ffi: `MoqFrame.timestamp_us` and `MoqDatagram.timestamp_us` are
    optional, null on a frame read from an untimed track, and default to null.
    A raw track you publish is timed, so a raw write without one now fails
    with `TimestampMismatch` instead of going out at 0.
    `MoqMediaProducer::write_frame` without one used to pass a PTS of 0; it
    now passes none, so the importer derives the time itself (elapsed since
    its first frame) or refuses a codec that needs one (avc1, hvc1).
    `MoqTrackInfo.timescale` is null on a received untimed track. In Go,
    `Frame.TimestampUs` and `Datagram.TimestampUs` are `*uint64`; in Kotlin
    and Dart, `Frame.timestamp` and `Datagram.timestamp` are nullable.
  - libmoq: `moq_frame` and `moq_datagram` gain `timestamp_present`, which
    changes their size, so recompile against the new `moq.h`.
  - Receivers: tracks from moq-lite before 05, and moq-transport tracks
    without `TIMESCALE` (every track on drafts 14–16), arrive untimed instead
    of stamped with their arrival time; an object-scope Timescale is ignored.
    On a moq-transport track with `TIMESCALE`, an object without a Timestamp
    is malformed. A new subscriber with no start on an untimed track starts at
    the latest group.
- **CMAF decodes at the frame timestamp.** A fragment's earliest sample
  presents at its moq-net frame timestamp; `tfdt` only orders the samples. In
  TypeScript, `Container.Format.decode` and `Cmaf.decodeDataSegment` take that
  timestamp: pass `frame.timestamp` alongside `frame.payload`, or `undefined`
  for an untimed frame, whose samples present at `tfdt`.
  `Cmaf.decodeTimestamp` is gone; the frame timestamp is the fragment's time.
  moq-mux's CMAF `Wire::write` refuses a track whose timescale isn't the init's
  `mdhd` timescale with `fmp4::Error::TimescaleMismatch`. `import::Track` and
  `TrackStream` accept a CMAF rendition's track at that timescale; a track you
  create yourself declares it with `track::Info::with_timescale`. Both decoders refuse a `trun` whose
  `data_offset` doesn't start at the next sample in the `mdat`.
- **@moq/json and @moq/flate consumers return `Timed` values.** The snapshot
  and stream consumers' `next()` and async iterator yield `{ value, at }`,
  where `at` is the frame's timestamp and absent on an untimed track; read
  `.value` for what they used to return. A snapshot consumer's `next()` now
  yields every state in order. Call `latest()` for the old behavior, which
  skips to the newest state. A caller that passes the result on as `any` or
  `unknown` (logging, `JSON.stringify`, a generic setter) still compiles but
  now gets the wrapper and every intermediate state, so search for each
  `next()` and `for await` over a snapshot consumer rather than relying on
  type errors. On an untimed track nothing marks a group stale, so a `next()`
  reader that falls behind replays the whole backlog where it used to skip it.

## Wire

Older protocol versions still negotiate, so relays and clients can be upgraded
in any order, apart from [pattern-only token grants](#relay-and-cli) and two wire
changes:

- The lite 06 ALPN is `moq-lite-06`, not `moq-lite-06-wip`. An explicit
  `moq-lite-06-wip` in a version list is refused (#3941).
- The hang catalog's root `timeline` entry is `archive`, and wall time moved to
  a root `clock: { wall, timescale }` (#3612, #3675). A new `moq export hls`
  finds no timeline in an old publisher's catalog, so upgrade publishers
  before the HLS gateway.

## Relay and CLI

The `moq-relay` and `moq` flags split into `--listen-*` (accepting),
`--connect-*` (dialing), and a shared `--quic-*` section. Environment
variables follow the flag (`MOQ_SERVER_BIND` is `MOQ_LISTEN`).

| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `--server-bind` | `--listen` |
| `--server-*`, `--tls-cert`, `--tls-key`, `--tls-generate` | `--listen-*`, `--listen-tls-cert`, `--listen-tls-key`, `--listen-tls-generate` |
| `--client-connect` | `--connect` |
| `--client-*` | `--connect-*` |
| `--client-failover-delay` | `--connect-race` |
| `--client-reconnect=false` | `--connect-once` (inverted) |
| `--tls-disable-verify`, `--client-tls-disable-verify` | `--connect-tls-insecure` |
| `--server-quic-*`, `--client-quic-*` | `--quic-*`, applied to both directions |
| TOML `[server]`, `[client]` | `[listen]`, `[connect]` |
| TOML `[server.quic]`, `[client.quic]` | `[quic]` |
| TOML `listen`, `connect`, `failover_delay`, `reconnect`, `disable_verify` | `bind`, `url`, `race`, `once` (inverted), `insecure` |
| `--cluster-linger` | removed; a broadcast closes when its last publisher is lost |
| `--cluster-connect host:port` | a full URL, `https://host/?jwt=TOKEN` |
| `--cluster-mesh`, TOML `mesh` | removed; list every peer with `--cluster-connect` or `--cluster-connect-api` |
| `moq --origin`, `--name`, `--latency-max` | `--hop` (removed for `--epoch` after [Unreleased](#unreleased)), `--broadcast`, `--max-age` |
| `moq publish`, `moq subscribe` | `moq import`, `moq export` |
| `moq token`, the `moq-token` binary | `moq auth` |

Other changes to a deployment:

- **Auth is one contract** (#3688). The relay asks an auth server per session
  (`--auth-url`) or applies a static anonymous grant (`--auth-public`); exactly
  one is required. `--auth-key`, `--auth-key-dir`, `--auth-api`,
  `--auth-api-mode`, `--auth-public-api`, `--auth-domain`, `--auth-mtls-tier`, and `--auth-tls-*`
  are gone: run `moq auth serve --key-dir ...` next to the relay and point
  `--auth-url` at it. The flag-by-flag mapping is in
  [Migrating from the relay flags](/bin/relay/auth#migrating-from-the-relay-flags).
- **Grants are patterns, not prefixes.** `anon` is now exactly the broadcast
  `anon`; write `anon/**` for the subtree. This applies to `--auth-public`,
  TOML `public`, and the `[auth.public]` table, which is now
  `public_subscribe` / `public_publish`. A public or mTLS pattern with no
  wildcard refuses to start, naming the subtree to write, rather than pick
  one reading silently. The patterns are rooted at `/`, as in 0.14, so
  `anon/**` admits a client dialed at `/anon` and refuses one dialed outside
  `anon/`. Earlier 0.15 releases rooted them at the dialed path instead.
- **Token grants are patterns.** JWT `publish` and `subscribe` claims are
  patterns, so a token granting `alice` covers only `alice`; sign `alice/**`
  instead. Existing `put`/`get` tokens and key scopes keep working as subtrees,
  and subtree-only grants are still signed in that form, so a `moq-token`
  deployment can upgrade issuers and verifiers in either order. Verifiers on
  the pattern-only `moq-auth` 0.1.0/0.1.1 or `@moq/auth` 0.1.x/0.2.0 refuse
  that form, so upgrade them before their issuers. Grants only a pattern can
  express need an upgraded verifier.
- **Removed auth settings refuse to start.** 0.14's `[auth]` `key`, `key_dir`,
  `auth_api`, `domains`, `mtls_tier`, and `[auth.tls]`, and their flags and
  `MOQ_AUTH_*` variables, stop the relay with the replacement named rather
  than being ignored.
- **Token claims.** `iss`, `sub`, and `jti` are ignored and `nbf` is enforced.
  Any other claim refuses the token with its name, `aud` and `cluster`
  included, where 0.14 ignored all but `aud`: an issuer adding app claims such
  as `user_id` must drop them.
- **Every credential is evaluated or refused.** A relay on `--auth-public`
  refuses a session presenting a token, as 0.14 did, including peers sending
  `cluster.token`, and refuses to start with a client CA. `moq auth serve`
  refuses a session presenting both a JWT and a certificate, so a peer
  presents one or the other.
- **`moq auth serve` never re-checks or expires by default**, as 0.14 never
  did. `--revalidate` needs `--expires`, and `--limit-*` needs `--revalidate`.
- **mTLS admits nothing on its own.** A verified client certificate is reported
  to the auth server, which grants it. `moq auth serve --mtls-publish '**' --mtls-subscribe '**' --mtls-peer` restores the old full access for every certificate
  the relay's client CA verifies, as a cluster peer, so keep that CA to cluster peers.
- **`moq --listen` needs auth.** A CLI listener refuses to start without
  `--auth-url` or `--auth-public` instead of accepting everyone.
- **Gossip discovery is removed.** A relay dials only the peers it lists or
  finds on the LAN, never a URL learned from an announcement, and no longer
  announces `.internal/origins`. The `/nodes` endpoint lists only peers this
  relay dialed. Until every relay that ran `--cluster-mesh` is upgraded, keep
  client grants off `.internal/`: an older relay still dials any URL announced
  there with `cluster.token`, and an upgraded peer still forwards it.
- **Other 0.14 auth differences kept.** Peers identify by certificate or LAN
  path. An auth server's `root` alias may have any depth.
  A path in `--cluster-connect` is not refused, although it shifts the mesh
  frame. `moq auth serve --key` takes a file, not an https or JWKS URL.
  `moq auth sign --root` is the token root and JS `verify --root` the dialed
  path. `/.cluster*` roots are reserved. `--auth-public a,b` splits on commas.
- **noq is the only QUIC stack** (#3811). The `quinn` and `quiche` cargo
  features and the backend setting are gone.
- **Stats counters** are `*_started` / `*_ended` (`sessions_started`,
  `announces_ended`, ...). This release still writes the old `announced` /
  `*_closed` names beside them, so move consumers now.

## GStreamer

- `moqsink` properties `estimated-send-bitrate` / `estimated-recv-bitrate` are
  `estimated-send-rate` / `estimated-recv-rate`, with no alias; a `gst-launch`
  line naming the old ones fails at runtime.

## Rust

- **moq-native is moq-tokio** (#2896). moq-native 0.20.0 is a stub that fails
  to compile with the rename. `ClientConfig::default().init()?` is
  `moq_tokio::connect::Config::default().init(quic)?`, and
  `with_publisher(&origin).with_subscriber(origin)` is `with_origin(origin)`.
  Names sit under their modules (`connection::Goaway`, `connection::Monitor`,
  `transport::Session`; #3745).
- **moq-token is moq-auth** (#3684). `Claims` holds `Patterns`, and
  `Claims::authorize` returns pattern residuals.
- **Origins** (#3400, #3804). `Origin::random().produce()` is
  `moq_tokio::origin::spawn()`. `create_broadcast(path, route)` is
  `origin.publish(path, route)`, or `create_broadcast(path)` then
  `broadcast.announce(route)`. `with_root` plus `scope(prefixes)` is one
  `scope(root, &patterns)` returning `Result`. `origin::Info` is
  `origin::Config`.
- **Announcements are prefix routes** (#3225, #3770). `announce::Update` is
  `{ prefix, route, kind, captures }`: skip `!update.kind.is_active()` and
  resolve the broadcast with `consumer.request_broadcast(&update.prefix, update.route.epoch)`.
  Serve a subtree on demand with `origin.dynamic(prefix, route)`.
- **Tracks.** `with_latency_max` / `latency_max` is `with_max_age` / `max_age`.
  `write_datagram(Datagram)` is `insert_datagram(sequence, timestamp, payload)`
  (#3666); `append_datagram` is unchanged. `track::SubscriberControl` is
  `track::Control`, `track::GroupRequest` is `group::Request`, and
  `ConnectionStats` is `session::Stats` with `estimated_send_rate` /
  `estimated_recv_rate`.
- **Oversized groups abort** with `GroupTooLarge` instead of shedding their head
  (#3585).
- **Catalog edits are fallible** (#3644, #3813). moq-mux and moq-json `lock()`
  is `modify()?`, and a guard that fails to publish on drop aborts the
  track. `timeline::Config::wall` is the broadcast `Clock`.
- **moq-json config** (#3718). `compression: bool` is a `Compression` enum;
  track-owning options are `producer::Config` / `consumer::Config`.
- **moq-mux imports are typed.** `import::Init` splits into `AudioInit`,
  `VideoInit`, and `ContainerInit`, with typed formats instead of strings, and
  `Track::new` is `Track::audio` / `Track::video`.
- **moq-relay embedding** (#3638). `Relay` fields are private: clone the
  handles you need, mount routes, then call `Relay::run`.
  `Cluster::with_cache` moved to `cluster::Options`.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript packages have no changelog; this list follows the breaking
PRs, so a minor rename may be missing.

- **@moq/token is @moq/auth.** `sign` / `verify` are `Key.sign` / `Key.verify`,
  and claims are pattern unions (see [Token grants are patterns](#relay-and-cli)).
- **One `Connection`** (#3614, #3636). `Connection.Reload` is
  `new Moq.Connection({ url })`, which pools one connection per relay. `closed`
  settles only on `close()`; the error that stopped retrying is `error`.
- **Origins hold broadcasts** (#2705, #3225). `connection.publish(path,
  broadcast)` is `origin.createBroadcast(path)` then `broadcast.announce()`, and
  `connection.announced(prefix)` is `origin.announced(scope)` yielding
  `{ prefix, kind, route }`. `ignoreSelf` is gone: reflected announces
  are always dropped.
- **Names mirror Rust** (#3710). `latencyMax` is `maxAge` (a `Time.Milli`),
  `writeDatagram` is `insertDatagram`, and `RemoteError` is `Error.Stream` /
  `Error.Session`.
- **@moq/watch** (#3396, #3817). `latency`, `latency-min`, `latency-max`, and
  `jitter` are `delay` and `buffer`, which need a unit (`delay="100ms"`,
  `buffer="30s"`). `reload` is `announced`. `Watch.Broadcast({ connection })`
  is `Watch.Player({ origin: connection.origin, ... })`.
- **@moq/publish** takes `origin: connection.origin` instead of a
  `connection` signal.
- **@moq/json and @moq/binary** (now `@moq/flate`) take one options object (#3640):
  `new Json.Snapshot.Consumer({ track })` instead of `(track, config)`.
- **@moq/hang** reads the catalog `archive` entry instead of `timeline`.

## Bindings

Python (`moq-rs` 0.5.0), Swift (0.5.0), Kotlin (`dev.moq:moq` 0.5.0), and Go
wrap moq-ffi 0.4. These are the moq-ffi names; each wrapper follows them in its
own casing:

- **Go module path** is `moq.dev/moq` (was `github.com/moq-dev/moq-go/moq`).
- **Publish split by kind.** `publish_media*` is `publish_audio`,
  `publish_video`, or `publish_container`, each taking its own init. The raw
  encoder paths that used to be `publish_audio` / `publish_video` are
  `encode_audio` / `encode_video`.
- **Durations are microseconds** (`max_age_us`, `MoqBackoff.initial_us`), and
  rate estimates are `estimated_send_rate` / `estimated_recv_rate`.
- **Setters are fallible** (#3642). Client and server configuration setters
  return an error (`Busy` during connect or listen) instead of dropping the
  value. `set_tls_disable_verify(bool)` is `set_tls_verify(bool)`.
- **Announcements.** `MoqAnnounced` is `MoqAnnounceConsumer` and
  `MoqAnnouncement` is `MoqAnnounceUpdate`; `MoqBroadcastRequest::abort` is
  `reject`, and `MoqOriginOptions` is `MoqOriginConfig`.
- **`MoqAudioCodec`** is an `opus()` object (#3671).
- **Errors.** `MoqError::Protocol` carries a `MoqProtocolError` (scope, wire
  code, kind) instead of a flattened message.
- **Track and group `finish()`** keeps the handle open so a later `abort()` can
  still run.

C (libmoq 0.6):

- The 41 `moq_client_*` setters are one zero-initializable `moq_client_config`,
  whose durations are `_us`.
- `moq_publish_media` is `moq_publish_audio`, `moq_publish_video`, or
  `moq_publish_container`; the raw encoders are `moq_encode_audio*` /
  `moq_encode_video*`. Formats are enums instead of strings.
- `moq_announced` is `moq_announce_update`, `moq_origin_consume_announced` is
  `moq_origin_announced_broadcast`, and `moq_broadcast_request_abort` is
  `moq_broadcast_request_reject`.
