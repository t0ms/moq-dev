//! The moq-transport error code registries, per negotiated draft.

//! This module holds the stream reset registry; [`request`] holds the one for rejecting a
//! request. The two are disjoint, so the same integer means different things in each.
//!
//! # Stream reset codes
//!
//! Sent on RESET_STREAM and STOP_SENDING, and read back off both. The values are the
//! draft's, not [`StreamError::to_code`]'s: the two registries agree on most of what they
//! both assign, but not all of it, and this one grew (and moved a value) across the drafts
//! we negotiate, so a code only means something once you know which draft carried it.
//!
//! | Code | draft-14/15 | draft-16 | draft-17 | draft-18+ |
//! |------|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|
//! | 0x0  | INTERNAL_ERROR | INTERNAL_ERROR | INTERNAL_ERROR | INTERNAL_ERROR |
//! | 0x1  | CANCELLED | CANCELLED | CANCELLED | CANCELLED |
//! | 0x2  | DELIVERY_TIMEOUT | DELIVERY_TIMEOUT | DELIVERY_TIMEOUT | DELIVERY_TIMEOUT |

//! GOING_AWAY sent to a draft-17 peer reads as UNKNOWN_OBJECT_STATUS, and a draft-17
//! peer's UNKNOWN_OBJECT_STATUS read as GOING_AWAY would retire a session that is not
