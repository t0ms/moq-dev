# SRT

`moq import srt` accepts SRT pushes (`--listen`) or pulls from a remote SRT
source (`--connect`); `moq export srt` serves SRT to players or pushes to a
remote. The payload is MPEG-TS, so the same codecs and behavior as
[`import ts`](/bin/cli) apply: H.264/H.265 video and AAC, MP2, AC-3, or E-AC-3
audio. A damaged unit is dropped and the session stays up; video resumes at its
next keyframe, freezing for up to one GOP.

```bash
# Accept a contribution feed and publish it
moq --connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast event.hang import srt --listen '[::]:9000'

# Serve a broadcast to SRT players
moq --connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast event.hang export srt --listen '[::]:9000'
ffplay srt://localhost:9000

# Pull from a remote encoder
moq --connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast event.hang import srt --connect 'srt://encoder.example.com:9000?streamid=live/cam'
```

Each connection publishes under a fresh
[epoch](/concept/moq-lite#publisher-epochs), so an encoder that reconnects
while its stale connection is still open replaces it at once: viewers see the
broadcast restart, and their next subscribe reaches the new feed. An
`export srt` stream ends with its broadcast; `--linger` and `--stitch` follow a
return or a replacement on the same connection, as they do for
[`export ts`](/bin/cli#retention-and-latency).

A multi-program feed is refused unless `--program`
picks one: `--program 2` imports program 2 alone, and `--program all`
publishes each program as its own broadcast (`event.hang` becomes
`event/1.hang`, `event/2.hang`, and so on).

```bash
moq --connect https://relay.example.com/anon --broadcast event.hang import srt --listen '[::]:9000' --program all
```

`--latency` (default 500 ms) sets the SRT receive buffer and doubles as the
export's jitter buffer, like `export ts --delay` in the [CLI](/bin/cli#export):
a frame arriving later than that is dropped. A `--connect` URL needs a
`streamid` query or a path; a listener bridges one `--broadcast` and ignores
the stream id it is offered. The library is [`moq-srt`](https://docs.rs/moq-srt).
