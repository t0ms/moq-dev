//! The unified moq-cli argument surface.
//!
//! Grammar: `moq <MoQ side> <stage> [-- <stage>]...`, where a stage is
//! `<import|export> <endpoint> [endpoint opts]`, plus `moq <MoQ side> play` for
//! native playback, `moq <MoQ side> announced [prefix]` to follow what is announced, and
//! `moq <MoQ side> fetch <track>` to read one group.
//!
//! - The MoQ side (`--connect`, the `--listen*` transport binds, `--cluster-lan`,
//!   and `--cluster-connect` / `--cluster-connect-api`; all optional, at least
//!   one) attaches the shared Origin to the MoQ network, and comes before the
//!   first stage. They compose: dial a relay, accept incoming sessions, mesh
//!   with the LAN, and join a cluster all at once.
//! - `import` routes media INTO MoQ from one source; `export` routes it OUT to
//!   one sink. The verb fixes the data direction (and thus, for the
//!   bidirectional gateways, whether `--connect`/`--listen` push or pull).
//! - `devices` and `token` touch no network at all, so they're the verbs that take
//!   no MoQ side. That's why the requirement is enforced per-verb
//!   ([`MoqSide::validate`]) rather than by the parser: an argument group can't be
//!   conditional on the subcommand.
//! - The endpoint is one subcommand: a container format (`ts`, `fmp4`, ... read
//!   from stdin on import, written to stdout on export) or a gateway (`hls`,
//!   `rtmp`, `srt`, `rtc`, `archive`). Exactly one per stage, so "which endpoint" is
//!   unambiguous and there's no silently-ignored flag.
//! - `--` starts another stage on the same Origin and the same MoQ attachment, so
//!   one process can bridge several broadcasts (or both directions at once). Usage
//!   can't express a repeated subcommand, so [`Invocation`] splits argv on `--`
//!   and runs each chunk through a real parser: every stage keeps full validation
//!   and its own `--help`. That claims `--` from Usage, which would otherwise treat
//!   it as the end-of-options marker. The only positional it could have escaped is
//!   an `import hls` playlist path starting with `-`, which `./-name` covers, so
//!   the separator stays unconditional rather than context-sensitive.
