/**
 * Lossy latest-value JSON publishing over MoQ tracks.
 *
 * One JSON value updated over time, for consumers that care about the state rather than every
 * record (a catalog, a status document). This mode is **lossy** by design: a new group supersedes
 * the older ones, which are dropped. {@link Consumer.next} yields every state it still receives,
 * in order, each with its frame's timestamp, for a caller that picks the state at a playhead.
 * {@link Consumer.latest} jumps straight to the newest group and collapses any buffered backlog
 * into a single yield, for a caller that only wants the current value. For an ordered log where
 * every record is preserved, use the `Stream` module instead.
 *
 * On the wire the value is a series of self-contained groups: frame 0 is a full snapshot and any
 * following frames are RFC 7396 JSON Merge Patch deltas applied in order. Interoperable with the
 * Rust `moq_json::snapshot`.
 *
 * The encoder rolls a group on its own budget, but a caller can roll one for its own reasons with
 * {@link Producer.cut}: it closes the open group and leaves the next update to open the replacement
 * with a full snapshot, so the deltas already written stop being provisional without publishing an
 * empty group.
 *
 * {@link Producer} and {@link Consumer} own a track: pass a {@link Producer.Config} /
 * {@link Consumer.Config} (`{ track, ... }`) and they manage the groups
 * for you. {@link Encoder} and {@link Decoder} are the same logic without the track. The encoder turns
 * values into {@link Encoded} frame payloads and says where the group boundaries fall; the decoder
 * reconstructs a value from those payloads. Reach for them when something else is already in charge
 * of the track.
 *
 * Encoding advances state that the frame's consumers depend on, so {@link Encoder.update} hands back
 * a {@link Pending} the caller commits once the write succeeds. Leaving one uncommitted
 * resynchronizes the encoder, which keeps a frame that never reached the wire from desyncing the
 * stream.
