# [M] TS export carries ATSC AC-3 at every A/52 rate

## Goal

`moq export ts` carries AC-3 as ATSC (`stream_type` 0x81, with the 2,592-byte
main buffer of ATSC A/53 Part 5) at every A/52 rate up to 640 kb/s without
missing a decode deadline, and the output passes `compliance.py`'s strict
`tstd` check. Today every rate from 384 kb/s up aborts the export, and 384 and
448 kb/s 5.1 is ATSC's standard main audio. The carriage stays ATSC: DVB AC-3
(5,696 B) already fits every rate, and E-AC-3 has
[its own quest](/quest/m2/ts-eac3.md).

## Plan

Decided (2026-10-10), planned from #5207, whose multi-PID `--headroom` arm had
to drop its AC-3 to 192 kb/s. `Schedule::admit`
(`rs/moq-mux/src/container/ts/schedule.rs`) keeps a unit's bytes in its
decoder buffer until the 25 ms slot after its due slot is past, not until it
decodes. AC-3 frames are 32 ms apart, so two frames' due slots can be one
apart, and the second must then fit beside the whole first: at 384 kb/s the
two hold 3,312 B against 2,592. The T-STD (ISO 13818-1 2.4.2.3) frees B at the
decode instant, and a 448 kb/s frame takes about 7 ms at Rx = 2 Mb/s, leaving
some 25 ms of its 32 ms spacing. The B overflow (122 %) graded on that run's
partial output is the same coarse timing, not a separate bug.

- Free each unit's bytes at its decode instant, for every PID with a decoder
  buffer (AC-3, AAC, MP2, E-AC-3, and video's EB), so the schedule follows the
  standard everywhere rather than special-casing AC-3. In the slot where a
  buffer frees up, the packets admitted against the freed room go after that
  instant: `Slot::layout` (from #5207) gains an earliest position per PID
  beside its round-robin. Chosen over admitting by sub-slots (the same idea,
  coarser) and over shrinking the 25 ms PCR grid, which would cost each PID
  about a tenth of its Rx to the per-slot slack, 2.5 times the clock packets,
  and every PCR-timing expectation.
- [Send-ahead](/quest/m1/tstd/send-ahead.md) bounds a unit's reach by what its
  decoder buffer holds and changes the same code; whichever lands second
  rebases onto the other.
- Test: schedule unit tests at 384, 448, 512, and 640 kb/s frame sizes against
  the 2,592 B buffer, each frame finishing by its deadline, with the existing
  decoder-buffer tests moved to the exact decode instant. Raise the
  `--headroom` arm's AC-3 (`test/ts/run.sh`) from 192 to 640 kb/s, the worst
  case, so CI grades it under strict `tstd` on every run.
