/**
 * JSON publishing over MoQ tracks, in three modes:
 *
 * - {@link Snapshot}: **lossy**. One JSON value updated over time; a newer group supersedes the
 *   older ones, and a consumer can read every state it receives or skip to the most recent.
 * - {@link Stream}: **lossless**. An ordered append-log of self-contained records; every record
 *   is preserved and delivered in order, nothing is ever superseded.
 * - {@link Window}: a **bounded** run of records, appended to the back and dropped from the front,
 *   that a reader can join at any point.
 *
 * Pick {@link Snapshot} when consumers care about "what is the value now" (a catalog, a status
 * document), {@link Stream} when they care about every record of an unbounded log, and
 * {@link Window} when the publisher retires old records and a late reader should start from what is
 * still retained (a media timeline).
 *
 * Each mode comes in two layers. `Producer`/`Consumer` own a track and manage its groups.
 * `Encoder`/`Decoder` are the same logic without the track: values in, frame payloads out (and
 * back), with the encoder saying where the group boundaries fall. Reach for the codec layer when
 * something else already owns the track.
