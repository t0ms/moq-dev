# [L] Sans-IO lite session

## Goal

The lite session is a state machine fed bytes, stream open and close events,
and `tick(now)`; it returns bytes to write and events for the model. No
transport stream types, no timers of its own, no async outside the `async`
feature. The starting point (refreshed in the 2026-10-10 audit): lite already
has a named polling driver in `rs/moq-net/src/lite/session.rs`, driven with
caller-supplied time through `rs/moq-net/src/driver.rs`. It still owns
`transport::poll::Session` and stream handles. The remaining work is the
byte/event boundary, async setup and helpers, and translating the tests.

## Plan

A hand-carved spike (lite-06 subscriber: SETUP, ANNOUNCE, SUBSCRIBE, group
streams, deadlines via `tick`) came to about 600 lines with frames surfaced
as `[offset, len]` ranges into the caller's chunk, so payload bytes are never
copied by the core. Decode every complete frame already buffered in one pass;
awaiting per frame is where js/net loses 2.5-3.5 µs per frame.

Guidance:

- Keep the session's existing behavior and wire exactly; the interop suite is
  the check.
- Stream handles, write backpressure, and close codes become explicit events
  or return values the driver acts on.
- Keep maps as Vec slabs where the key space is small.
- Turn the session's async test bodies into synchronous `poll_*` tests with
  explicit instants as it is rewritten, so they translate with the code.

Public API: breaks moq-net's session API. Wire: none.

## Required

- [rs2ts](/quest/m1/rs2ts/translator.md) - its go/no-go decides whether moq-net breaks its API for generated TypeScript
