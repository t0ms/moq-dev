/// Decode a moq-lite track into a stream of media [`Frame`]s in age-bounded
/// presentation order.
///
/// `Consumer` wraps a [`moq_net::track::Subscriber`] and a [`Container`]
/// format implementation, typically
/// [`catalog::hang::Container`](crate::catalog::hang::Container). Yields
/// decoded frames via [`read`](Self::read).
///
/// ## Ordering & age skipping
///
/// Groups can arrive on the wire out of order. The consumer always reads frames *within*
/// a group in arrival order, but across groups it advances by sequence number, skipping
/// a stalled or missing group once everything it could still present (bounded by where
/// the next group begins) falls a full budget behind the newest content, the same reach
/// [`moq_net::track::Subscription::max_delay`] measures. With the default max delay of zero,
/// the consumer skips aggressively: any group that has a newer alternative is dropped.
/// With a non-zero max delay, slow groups are tolerated up to that budget before being
/// skipped. A missing sequence gets the same tolerance: there is no way to tell a stream
/// that lost the delivery race from one the cache evicted.
///
/// Delivery starts at the [`Subscription::start`](moq_net::track::Subscription::start)
/// floor when one is named, waiting for that group under the budget; without one it
/// starts wherever the publisher does, adopted from the first served groups. From there
/// the same budget is the one rule that catches the consumer up to the live edge, and
/// history the publisher no longer serves expires like any other gap, since its reach
/// sits a full budget behind the newest content.
///
/// A stalled group is also skipped early, regardless of the max delay budget, once it has
/// presented up to where the next group begins. CMAF frames carry a per-sample duration,
/// so a group whose most recent frame ends (timestamp + duration) at or past the next
/// group's first timestamp has nothing left worth waiting for. Containers without a
/// duration report zero, which disables this check and falls back to the max delay budget.
///
/// Put the initial max delay on the [`moq_net::track::Subscription`] before
/// subscribing. [`new`](Self::new) inherits that budget, and
/// [`set_max_delay`](Self::set_max_delay) changes it mid-stream.
///
/// ## Timeline discontinuities
///
/// A marker group (no decodable frames, one empty payload) is a walk-now discontinuity.
/// A delivered sequence hole is a playhead event unless the boundary is contiguous within
/// 1 ms, and a latency skip is the same event. [`discontinuity`](Self::discontinuity) is
/// that playhead generation: re-apply startup delay and skip, not a decoder flush.
/// Empty groups (zero objects) mean nothing. A group whose timestamps fall below the live
/// edge earlier groups reached is malformed and aborts the track.
