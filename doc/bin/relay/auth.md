description: "One auth contract for moq-relay: an auth server per session, or a static anonymous grant"
---

# Authentication

A relay admits a session in exactly one of two ways:

| Flag | What admits |
| --- | --- |
| `--auth-url` | An auth server, asked once per session event with everything the relay knows. `moq auth serve` is the reference server; a Worker or a service of your own answers the same contract. |
| `--auth-public` | A static grant for anonymous sessions: patterns rooted at `/`, like a token with an empty root. No server. |

Setting both, or neither, fails at startup; an application that embeds the
relay may leave both unset and decide [in process](#in-process) instead.
Nothing else admits anyone: a verified client certificate is a fact the server
weighs, never a grant on its own. A grant names publish and subscribe rights as
path patterns under a root, and the session can only see that part of the tree.

## The contract

The relay POSTs one JSON body per session event (`connect`, `revalidate`,
`end`) to `--auth-url` and reads a grant back. The request carries everything
the relay knows: a session id, its own `node` name, the transport, addresses,
SNI and ALPN, the path and query exactly as dialed, a moq-transport SETUP
token, the declared role, and the verified client certificate. Nothing is
parsed on the server's behalf: the `jwt` query parameter is a convention of
`moq auth serve`, not of the relay. The grant answers with `publish` and
`subscribe` pattern unions and optionally a `root` alias, read-only `mounts`,
`expires`, a `revalidate` cadence, a stats `tier`, and `peer` / `upstream` to
mark another relay and an [upstream link](/bin/relay/cluster#upstream-links).
The fields are documented on `moq_auth::Request` and `moq_auth::Grant`
([Rust](/lib/rs/moq-auth), [TypeScript](/lib/js/auth)).

**Connect.** A 2xx with a grant admits. A 401 or 403 refuses. Anything else,
including a timeout or an unparseable body, refuses and logs an error, so
nothing is admitted because the server was down. A grant that names nothing
refuses, and so does one already expired: expiry is exact, with no grace for
clock skew, so keep the auth server's clock in sync.

**Revalidate.** On the grant's cadence the relay asks again. A grant with the
same `root` and `mounts` resizes the live session in place, narrower or wider,
so a moderation decision lands on the session it targets and can be lifted the
same way: what falls outside a narrower grant resets with `Unauthorized`, the
broadcasts the session published outside it abort, and everything else keeps
flowing. A wider grant brings those paths back, up to what the session was
admitted with. A one-shot HTTP `/fetch` ends on a narrower grant instead. A
changed `root`, `mounts`, `peer`, or `upstream` closes the session. A changed
`tier` keeps the session and moves its stats from then on. A 401 or
403 closes it. Any other failure retries with backoff and the session lives
until `expires`, so an outage always has the bound the server chose. A grant
with `revalidate` must set `expires` for that reason.

**End.** Every close reports `end` with the reason, the duration, and the
bytes sent and received.

**The link.** `https://` presents the relay's `connect.tls` client certificate
when one is configured, so a remote server can tell which relay is asking;
`unix://` speaks HTTP over a socket; `http://` is accepted for a loopback host
only. There is no shared secret.

```toml
[auth]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:4440/"
```

### Push

An operator or the auth server can ask a node to re-check sessions now instead
of waiting for the cadence, so a kick, a gate, or a retier lands in one round
trip. A push decides nothing: the relay asks the server again and applies its
answer exactly as a scheduled re-check would. The internal listener selects
sessions by the fields the server already saw; see
[`/sessions`](/bin/relay/http#get-sessions).

```bash
# Kick one session.
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9101/sessions/revalidate?id=00ff'

# Re-check everyone under a path.
curl -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9101/sessions/revalidate?path=demo/**'

moq auth revalidate --internal-url http://127.0.0.1:9101 --id 00ff
```

A push reaches one node. The server already knows each session's `node` from
`connect` and calls that relay.

## Tokens

With `moq auth serve`, a client presents a JWT in `?jwt=`. Generate a key,
sign a token, hand it to the client. Install the [moq CLI](/setup/install)
and use its `moq auth` subcommand.

```bash
# Asymmetric: the relay only needs public.jwk.
moq auth generate --algorithm ES256 --out private.jwk --public public.jwk

# Let the bearer publish under rooms/123/alice and subscribe to anything in rooms/123.
moq auth sign --key private.jwk --root rooms/123 --publish 'alice/**' --subscribe '**' --expires "$(( $(date +%s) + 3600 ))" > alice.jwt

moq auth verify --key public.jwk --in alice.jwt
```

```bash
moq auth serve --key public.jwk   # or --key-dir /etc/moq/keys/ or --key-set /etc/moq/keys.jwks
```

The client dials `https://relay.example.com/rooms/123?jwt=<token>`. A
moq-transport client can instead put the JWT in its SETUP's `AUTHORIZATION
TOKEN` option with Token Type 0. HMAC, RSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA keys all work. A
key can itself be **scoped** at generation (`--root`, `--publish`,
`--subscribe`), after which it can never sign a broader token.

### Claims

| Claim | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `root` | Base path. Optional. |
| `publish` | Patterns the bearer may publish under `root`. `**` means everything; omitted means no publishing. |
| `subscribe` | Patterns the bearer may subscribe to under `root`. Same rules. |
| `exp`, `iat`, `nbf` | Expiry, issue time, and not-before. `exp` is enforced for the whole session, not just at connect, and a token is refused from its `exp` on and before its `nbf`. |
| `iss`, `sub`, `jti` | Read and ignored. |

Any other claim refuses the token with its name, `aud` included: an unknown
claim may narrow the grant, and a misspelled `root` would otherwise widen it to
everything. Put application data somewhere other than the token.

Tokens and key scopes from the older `moq-token` format still work: each `put`
and `get` prefix `p` reads as the subtree `p/**`.

### Path matching

Grants are [patterns](https://docs.rs/moq-pattern) relative to `root`: `foo`
is exactly `foo`, `foo/**` is `foo` and everything beneath it, `live/*` is
every broadcast one segment under `live`, and `**` is everything. Matching is
on path boundaries (`foo/**` covers `foo/bar` but not `foobar`), and the relay
announces, publishes, and resolves only paths inside the grant. `moq auth
serve` authorizes the token at the dialed path: the path may equal the root,
extend it (which narrows the grant), or be a parent of it (the grant still
applies at the root). An unrelated path is rejected.

The session's root is always the path it dialed, and what it sees is named
relative to that. For a grant of `demo/**` from the root:

| Dialed | Session root | Granted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/demo/bar` | `demo/bar` | `**` |
| `/demo` | `demo` | `**` |
| `/` | \`\` | `demo/**` |
| `/other` | refused | |

Anonymous and mTLS rules, on the relay and in `moq auth serve`, are authorized
the same way, as a token with an empty root.

| root | publish | subscribe | Publish | Subscribe |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `demo` | `my-stream/**` | `**` | `demo/my-stream/**` | `demo/**` |
| `demo` | (none) | `**` | nothing | `demo/**` |
| `""` | `**` | `**` | everything | everything |

Libraries: [`moq-auth`](/lib/rs/moq-auth) (Rust) and [`@moq/auth`](/lib/js/auth) (TypeScript) sign and verify the same tokens.

## Anonymous access

```toml
[auth]
public = "anon/**"                    # anyone may publish and subscribe under anon/

# or asymmetric rules:
public_subscribe = ["anon/**", "demo/**"]
public_publish = ["anon/**"]
```

A static grant with no expiry and no re-check. Nothing here verifies a token,
so a session presenting one is refused rather than admitted on the public
grant. The patterns are rooted at `/`, like a token with an empty root (see
[Path matching](#path-matching)): `anon/**` admits a session dialed at `/`,
`/anon`, or `/anon/room`, and refuses one dialed anywhere else. A pattern with
no wildcard, such as `anon`, refuses to start; write `anon/**` for the subtree.
`public = "**"` opens everything and is for development only. With
`--auth-url` the anonymous rules live on the server instead
(`moq auth serve --public-*`).

## mTLS

`listen.tls.root` verifies a client certificate chain at the handshake, and a
bad chain fails there. What the certificate admits is the server's decision:
the relay reports it in the request and enforces the grant it gets back.
`moq auth serve` grants a certificate only what `--mtls-publish` and
`--mtls-subscribe` name, nothing by default. Public rules ignore certificates,
so `--auth-public` with a client CA refuses to start. Only the QUIC listener
verifies client certificates, so a relay without `listen.bind` refuses
`listen.tls.root` too.

Cluster peers are admitted the same way, so a mesh runs
`moq auth serve --mtls-publish '**' --mtls-subscribe '**' --mtls-peer` (or a
server granting its cluster CA everything with `peer: true`); see
[Clustering](/bin/relay/cluster). `--mtls-peer` marks every certificate as
another relay; leave it off when certificates identify clients.
`--mtls-upstream`, which needs `--mtls-peer`, also marks them
[upstream](/bin/relay/cluster#upstream-links). Changing either flag ends each
live mTLS session at its next re-check (the `--revalidate` cadence or a
`moq auth revalidate` push), so the mesh redials once.

```toml
[listen.tls]
root = ["/etc/moq/peer-ca.pem"]

[connect.tls]
cert = "/etc/moq/relay.pem"    # presented on outbound dials and to an https:// auth server
key = "/etc/moq/relay.key"
```

## Auth server

`moq auth serve` is the reference auth server, answering the contract above.

```bash
moq auth serve --listen 127.0.0.1:4440 \
  --key-dir /etc/moq/keys \
  --public-subscribe 'anon/**' --public-publish 'anon/**' \
  --mtls-publish '**' --mtls-subscribe '**' --mtls-peer \
  --tier edge --expires 1d --revalidate 1m --limit-remote 64
```

What a session presents decides what is checked. Every credential is either
evaluated or refused: nothing is ignored, and no two are combined.

| Presented | `--auth-public` | `--auth-url` to `moq auth serve` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nothing | the public rules | `--public-*`, or refused |
| a JWT | refused | verified, or refused |
| a certificate | never requested: a client CA refuses to start | `--mtls-*`, or refused |
| a JWT and a certificate | never requested | refused |

A JWT is verified against `--key FILE`, `--key-dir DIR`, or `--key-set FILE`
(by `kid`, read per request so rotation needs no restart) and authorized at the
dialed path, as in [Path matching](#path-matching). A bad token is refused; it
never falls through to the anonymous rules. A JWT presented with a certificate
is refused too, because neither can safely win, so a peer presents
`cluster.token` or a certificate, not both.

Nothing is re-checked or closed by default: a session lives until its token's
`exp` or its certificate's notAfter. `--expires D` bounds a grant with no bound
of its own. `--revalidate D` has the relay re-check each grant on that cadence,
and needs `--expires` so an outage still has a bound. Without `--revalidate`,
rotating or deleting a key does not close live sessions.

`--limit-token N` and `--limit-remote N` cap live sessions per token and per
remote address. They need `--revalidate`, and are a nuisance limit, not a
security boundary: approximate across relay crashes and server restarts, and
they gate admission without revoking.

`--listen unix:/run/moq-auth.sock` serves a socket. Binding anything but a
loopback address needs `--listen-public`: the server has no authentication of
its own. See `moq auth serve --help` for the rest.

### Migrating from the relay flags

The 0.14 relay's auth flags moved to `moq auth serve`, and the relay points
`--auth-url` at it. A relay without a server keeps `--auth-public`, as
patterns: `--auth-public 'PREFIX/**'`.

| 0.14 relay flag | `moq auth serve` |
| --- | --- |
| `--auth-key FILE` | `--key FILE` |
| `--auth-key-dir DIR` | `--key-dir DIR` |
| `--auth-public PREFIX` | `--public-publish 'PREFIX/**' --public-subscribe 'PREFIX/**'` |
| `--auth-public-publish` / `--auth-public-subscribe` | `--public-publish` / `--public-subscribe`, as patterns |
| `--auth-public-api URL` | your own server answering the contract |
| `--auth-mtls-tier LABEL` | `--tier LABEL` (one tier per server) |
| `listen.tls.root` alone admitting a peer unscoped | `--mtls-publish '**' --mtls-subscribe '**' --mtls-peer` |
| `--auth-api` (token or proxy mode), `Cache-Control` | `--auth-url` pointed at any server answering the contract; `revalidate` and `expires` in the grant |
| `--auth-domain` | your server reads `server_name` and decides |

Both on one host:

```bash
moq auth serve --listen 127.0.0.1:4440 --key-dir /etc/moq/keys --public-subscribe 'anon/**'
moq-relay --auth-url http://127.0.0.1:4440/
```

### In process

An application that [embeds](/bin/relay/#embed) the relay can decide
admissions itself, without the HTTP: leave `[auth]` empty and take
`relay.admissions()` before `run`. Each `Admission` carries the same
`moq_auth::Request` a server would read, and is answered with a lease or a
refusal. A fixed lease never changes; a `lease::Producer` the application keeps
re-checks, updates, and revokes on its own clock. The relay still closes the
session at the grant's `expires`, and an admission left unanswered for ten
seconds is refused. Gateway accept loops can call `Cluster::admit` for the same
scoped session as a native connection. See
[docs.rs/moq-relay](https://docs.rs/moq-relay) and
[moq-auth](/lib/rs/moq-auth).

## Stream listeners

The plaintext TCP and Unix-socket listeners are admitted exactly like QUIC:
the path and query ride the `SETUP` (`tcp://127.0.0.1:4444/room?jwt=...`) and
reach the auth server with `transport` set to `tcp` or `unix`. A Unix socket
can also require a specific uid, gid, or pid:

```toml
[listen.unix]
bind = "/run/moq/internal.sock"
allow.uid = [1001]
```

Bind plaintext TCP to loopback or a private interface; it carries no peer
identity. The Unix socket is created mode `0666`, so gate it with a restrictive
parent directory or an allowlist.

`listen.tcp.tls = true` serves the TCP listener over TLS instead, for `tls://`
dials such as [cluster links](/bin/relay/cluster#tls-links). It asks for no
client certificate, so a peer on it presents a token, not mTLS.
