//! SRT client (dial-out): connect to a remote SRT listener and bridge it to MoQ.
//!
//! The mirror of the crate's listener: where that binds a listener and accepts
//! callers, this *dials* a remote `srt://host:port` as an SRT caller and bridges
//! MPEG-TS in one of two directions, selected by the stream-id `m=` mode it sends:
//!
//! - **[`Client::publish`] (push / restream)**: call with `m=publish`, read a MoQ
//!   broadcast from an origin, re-mux it to MPEG-TS with [`moq_mux`], and send it
//!   to the remote listener. This restreams MoQ out to a remote SRT ingest.
//! - **[`Client::pull`] (ingest)**: call with `m=request`, receive the remote's
//!   MPEG-TS, demux it with [`moq_mux`], and publish the result into an origin as
//!   an ordinary MoQ broadcast. This ingests a remote SRT source.
//!
//! It reuses the same MPEG-TS <-> moq bridge and the server's
//! per-frame pacing; only the SRT caller transport is new. The `m=` mode we *send*
//! is the remote's view (it publishes to us on `m=request`, receives from us on
//! `m=publish`), the inverse of the local direction: a local pull asks the remote
//! to send (`m=request`), a local push tells the remote to receive (`m=publish`).
