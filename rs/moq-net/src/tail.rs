//! A subscription's tail: the group streams still owed once the publisher has ended it.
//!
//! A publisher ends a subscription only after every group stream it opened has finished,
//! but QUIC does not order streams, so one opened before the end can still reach us after
//! it. The subscriber keeps the subscription routable until each owed group is accounted
//! for, or a grace expires for a group whose stream was reset before its header arrived.
//! A reset that keeps the header (reliable reset) would make the grace unnecessary.
//!
//! A stream whose header arrived is read to its end whatever the grace says: a group ends
//! on its own stream's FIN or reset, never because its track ended. A lost datagram is not
//! owed: it leaves a hole that waits out the grace like a stream reset before its header.
