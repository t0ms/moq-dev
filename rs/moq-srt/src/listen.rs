//! SRT listener configuration and the unauthenticated `run` convenience.
//!
//! SRT is a thin reliability/encryption layer over a UDP datagram stream whose
//! payload, by overwhelming convention, is MPEG-TS. [`run`] drives a [`Server`]:
//! it accepts every connection and routes each by its stream-id `m=` mode, in one
//! of two directions:
//!
//! - `m=publish` (the default): ingest. Pump the caller's TS payload into the
//!   origin as a broadcast.
//! - `m=request`: egress. Re-mux the requested broadcast back to MPEG-TS and
//!   stream it to the caller, so VLC / ffmpeg can play
//!   `srt://host:port?streamid=#!::r=<broadcast>,m=request`.
//!
//! Routing: SRT's recommended stream-id form is `#!::r=<resource>,m=<mode>`. The
//! `r=` resource (or the raw stream id, for OBS-style clients) names the
//! broadcast, and the optional [`prefix`](Config::prefix) is prepended so a
//! single listener can namespace all of its streams (e.g. prefix `live/` + stream
//! id `cam0` -> broadcast `live/cam0`).
//!
//! Auth: [`run`] is unauthenticated. Anyone who can reach the UDP port can
//! publish or request any broadcast, so gate it with the host firewall / a
//! private network. To gate access (e.g. verify the stream id as a JWT) or to
//! scope the origin per client, drive [`Server`] directly: loop on
//! [`Server::accept`], match the [`Request`], and call accept/reject after making
//! your own decision.
